This cozy spot offers an authentic Mexican dining experience with a menu that's small but packed with flavor. Each taco feels like a trip to a different part of Mexico, featuring fresh ingredients and delicious homemade sauces that make every bite special. The Beef Birria and Cochinita Pibil are personal favorites--tender, perfectly seasoned, and incredibly satisfying. The option to add fresh onions, coriander, and lime for free gives it that extra touch of authenticity.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, with a small seating area that feels intimate yet vibrant. You can tell that quality is a priority here, as they focus on dine-in rather than delivery, ensuring that each dish is served fresh and hot. The staff are warm and knowledgeable, happy to answer questions or recommend a dish if you're unsure what to try.\n\nIf you're looking for real Mexican food in Amsterdam, Taco Lindo is the place to go! Great food, great vibe, and truly dedicated service.

I visited was in a slight panic trying to find takeaway places to order a quick late night meal that catered for my allergens.  By that point, I'd walked around for about 30 minutes trying to find a place with no luck, until I came to Hearth on 11 Oct 2024.  They'd sadly JUST stopped food service when I arrived, but the lovely owner, Marcus, took pity on my plight and offered some excellent gluten free and vegan quinoa sushi with dressing for free.  I was amazed by his wonderful generosity that I made a point to come and visit to try the menu out properly when my friend from London arrived.\n\nAnd that we did.  We visited on Sunday 13 October as walk-ins and everything from the food (presentation and flavour) the non-alcoholic cocktails, the ambience, and the service was nothing short of amazing.  Unfortunately Marcus wasn't there the night I visited as a sit-down guest, but I did offer him one promise...this review, so I send my heartfelt gratitude for his kindness and generosity.  He has a wonderful business.  The food was amazing...I couldn't fault the flavours and textures.  Please do yourself a favour and go - you will not be disappointed by the inventiveness of the dishes and drinks at this place.\n\nThank you again!

The whole ambience and decor of the restaurant is well thought out.\n\nNow the food? It was delicious. We ordered quite a few dishes and loved every single one! Plus the presentation? Like a Michelin star restaurant without the scary prices. We had the Leek and Potato soup, bread and olive starter, Mexican sushi, buckwheat gnocchi, and mushroom red lentil scallop. All dishes were amazing and definitely plentiful.\n\nYou can tell everything has been well thought out with this restaurant.

The waiter was an absolute sweetheart excited about the food helping with recommendations, serving the food in a really nice way.

They gave us a small  Amuse-bouche to start with and we ordered the Mexican sushi to share as a starter which was my personal highlight and as a main the charcoal ravioli and the buckwheat gnocchi with vegan ricotta cream. Both very tasty and beautifully served. As a dessert we had strawberry crumble. All in all it was amazing. A perfect choice if you want to try something special but not too high class. Absolutely loved it and will come back to try the other stuff on the menu"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-22T10:14:19"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOWAY4ciXSurwwur_RKECrnbE4WOtArizVGm3up=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPQ5Khd0Bqj9nuTr2zAIvrZRsfBa8EhhN5Y1-8u=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMtMSOHeFdBcKwYetbYA6bD1aAuPCLqINCmbyA2=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPQ4EiEKFd0hv8Dc4eL9ql-tNIJ0hYNptGkHjCK=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmck4yUHJBRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Maximilian Pitscheider"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111127018948536728150?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Warm, welcoming and with a keen eye for details, Hearth is outstanding.\n\nThe food and drinks were not only really good, but complex and take you on a journey in your mouth.

Everything is perfect here, we eat here at least once every month if we can help it. We take all our international friends and the friends who love food as much as we do. Martin and the other incredible people who work there are all perfect hosts and I haven't even started talking about the food and the cocktails. The cocktails are works of art, which get the same passionate description as art from the mixologists. Highly unique combinations, refreshing new ideas and perfectly balanced. We tried them all and every new addition and  our favourite is without a doubt the Paloma but all of the others are pretty much on the same top pedestal. The food is the most accurate representation of the concept, indulgence. We once ordered one dish 5 times on one night because it was just that addicting (the Tuna taco's) and the ever evolving menu leaves you wanting more and more. Writing this made me make a reservation right away.

We were a party of four having made reservations and paid an advance sum of EU30. As we came in we were immediately accosted by a very hyped up fast talking little man who was channeling some sort of rude, sped up Captain Jack Sparrow / Johnny Depp knock off vibe. With tables available we were asked to wait, for whatever reason, as the place is tiny and cramped and its very easy to overview seating. We told him we had reservations and wanted to eat and instead of being given a nice table were led through a corridor to the back and pointed to a mini table behind the kitchen, next to a larger empty table. Impossible for 4 people to sit and eat comfortably there so we sat down at the larger table, thinking we would leave immediately if they gave us any further trouble or rudeness. The place is dark and lit by red lights for some inexplicable reason so you cant see anything or read the menu really. We were already thinking of leaving due to the vibes given, but were set on food and drink and had paid ahead so we stayed. The concept here is Latino street food and their idea of musical accompaniment for this is an overly loud cringy throwback cypress hill insane in the membrane playlist that chatgpt would put together if you asked for a 90s west coast gangster rap playlist for a frat boy party. Zero points. Captain Jack Sparrow gave us some more lip about the table and having to order food and leaving in time so ignoring his vibe we ordered about EU140 worth of cocktails and food. Thankfully the orders came in fast. Cocktails are on tap but quite tasty and pretty although you need a flashlight to actually see them, as again, red lights make it impossible to see what the food and drink look like. Suddenly Jack Sparrow remembered he was a waiter and started rattling off what was in the cocktails, and incredibly, swearing while he chattered about the ingredients. It was ridiculously funny at this point. He left us unimpressed. The food that came was actually very tasty, and looked nice, under a flash light. We approached another waiter who seemed slightly more stable, for our second round. For some reason the staff here is very jittery and prone to inexplicable loudness. I wonder if they have any other unlisted Colombian staff only specialties available in the backroom? Anyway, our company was good and we laughed it all off before paying and leaving. Weird, small, loud and rude. Sort your staff out. And put together a better playlist, ese."",""published_at"":""4 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-14T11:04:47"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMKO1JqhHd-9mradKkQ-qNLOUbTUwD1997ndzx7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOugKtoMi7arlRBLPLIXArFmKC7O1nG--BdYDCv=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPzp2pjgJ9ECAO11U2p6DVQ8ZPKdz3q6Is_DB2u=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNWGU88DzDZBorh28GfEMzP_4ZsSMtrvLeB5yo-=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP9I_2eD4JCWVbzEzQkbki4kV-M9Wr7fhMCdGLB=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNRjVKOxhTiFURTTRExUcjxA9WFV_rZKsyrUQ2x=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMo24dQx_jVL6tl6MckN2JpON1dZGSOXI7Lt40V=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuNHBISWlRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Omri Harel"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102954641781224972059?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""This was such a gem!

try.\n\nOverall the restaurant has a nice ambiance, close tables next to each other by candle light, very cute and very cosy. Honestly the chips & salsa were amazing, not many Mexican places in Amsterdam serve you chips & salsa upon arrival. We ordered the pulled pork and chicken tacos, they were good, but not mind blowing for me. I wanted a bit more of an umami flavor in the meat, or an extra punch in the seasonings and salsa, I just didn't get that explosion of flavor that I usually get with Mexican food.

The service is also amazing, people are quick, the kitchen is quick and you don't have to wait 30 minutes to get the waiters attention. The music is also great! I feel like I'm back in Mexico. My favorite dishes are the tuna tostadas, the tacos of carne asada and cochinita pibil. The drinks are also super good! Finally a good margarita that doesn't taste like a cheap sugar drink.

It was so delicious and cozy. It is a small restaurant so reservations are necessary. But I think this adds to the appeal of this place. The bar is meters away from your table so you get the added benefit of watching the bartender shake up some fantastic cocktails. The wait staff are all very friendly and especially helpful on recommendations. This place is about Nachos and I love that they make their own corn (no gluten, added bonus for me) tortilla chips. From the first bite of my tasty Erasmus nachos to the last I was in heaven. The cocktails were the icing on top. I can't say enough good things about this place...

It really helps us ensure you leave happy if you inform us right on the spot about any issues; we're always more than happy to make things right.\n\nWe have informed our kitchen about the size of the arepa, as they are typically larger, especially since they are meant to be bite-sized under our bites section on the menu. Thank you for your feedback; we will make sure the size of the arepa is always consistent moving forward. Unfortunately, you received a smaller size, but we could have addressed this immediately if you had let us know.\n\nRegarding the patacones, there was a mistake with the type of plantain used; we mistakenly used the slightly yellow plantain instead of the green one. We understand this mistake and will ensure accuracy moving forward.\n\nWe truly value your feedback and hope you'll consider giving us another chance to provide you with a better experience in the future.

I feel that any low reviews might stem from not understanding the menu as to what Tomatillo offers. I will touch on that.\n\nThey do have alcoholic drinks (some reviews from years ago mentioned they did not - this has changed). I had white wine, and my wife had a margarita. She kept raving about how good it was and how she enjoyed its tartness.\n\nOur food was excellent. I had a fajita burrito which means it comes with more vegetables than just beans, rice, salsa, and cheese. My wife ordered just the burrito with pico de gallo and raved about it. I added habanero sauce on the side with mine and had it in a bowl. It came with two corn tortillas to make my own tacos with it. It was super good.\n\nLike any restaurant, one might have to figure out the offering and details that match one's taste preferences. My case in point is this: their carryout to people who have figured it out is robust. Don't miss this gem. It is really good. Dine in and let them explain the offerings.

Again we particularly enjoyed the tuna tostada with generous slices of very tasty tuna and the bbq dorade which was sizeable enough to make us need a few more tortilla s.

We hope something similar will be organized soon and under better weather circumstances so more people can enjoy it!\n\nDinner was excellent. We are big fans of the original masmais so were very excited about visiting this fish focused sister restaurant. It did not dissapoint. As it s still the soft opening they work with a set menu so you can try a lot of the dishes. All of them were delicious. Bbqed dorade and tuna tostada s were stand outs.\n\nIn addition to the food the drinks and service are also great. We enjoyed the smokey paloma the most. Staff was attentive and (unneccessarily) apologized when one course took slightly longer.\n\nThe restaurant also looks really nice. The decor is warm and neat. Bar seats looked great as well.

Nestled near our Airbnb, Bunk is a restaurant that not only delivers on quality but surpasses it in every imaginable way.\n\nThe menu at Bunk is a testament to creativity and finesse. Every dish we tried was a masterpiece, both in taste and presentation. The freshness and flavor of the ingredients were evident in every bite, each component thoughtfully selected and expertly combined. It's clear that Bunk takes immense pride in sourcing the best ingredients, transforming them into artful creations that delight the senses.\n\nOn our first night, we were so impressed that we decided to return the following evening to explore more of the menu. Amazingly, each dish we tried the second night was just as spectacular as the first, if not more so. The consistency in quality and the continuous surprise of new flavors left us in awe. It's rare to find a restaurant that excels across the board, but Bunk manages to do just that.\n\nThe drinks were another highlight of our experience. Each cocktail was crafted with the same attention to detail as the food, perfectly complementing the dishes and enhancing the overall dining experience.\n\nIn our opinion, Bunk is hands down the best restaurant in Amsterdam. It's a hidden treasure that deserves to be celebrated. If you find yourself in this beautiful city, do yourself a favor and visit Bunk.

We tried a hot dog with cheese , bacon and sausage , the hotdog had a pretzel bread which was super nice and it was over all tasty too. The edamame beans from a different stand were very good too , I didn't get to try the scallion pancakes as there was a long queue , i really wanted but i would definitely love to try it next time. Would recommend coming here around 12:20 as it opened at 12 for us and it wasn't as busy at that time but then got very busy. The atmosphere is great , everyone is enjoying the food and music.

The dish included cabbage, green beans, and eggs, all topped with a rich and thick peanut sauce that provided a wonderful peanut flavor. The vegetables were perfectly boiled, adding a satisfying texture to the dish.\nNext, I sampled the Nasi Campur, a traditional Indonesian dish. This platter had an assortment of items including rendang and vegetables. The rendang, one of Indonesia's national dishes, was absolutely delicious. Its rich and complex flavors complemented the fried rice perfectly.\nOverall, Iboenda impressed me with its authentic flavors and high-quality ingredients. If you're in Amsterdam and craving Indonesian cuisine, I highly recommend giving Iboenda a try.

The woman highly recommended eating at iBoenda as she said the food was the best Indonesian restaurant in the Netherlands in her opinion. Well, this woman was not wrong. It is little paradise in my opinion! You will never get an authentic, traditional and fantastic home cooked cuisine anywhere in the world as good as this restaurant! I've eaten in Indonesia too...I'm not exaggerating. They also do take aways and an equivalent to 'Just Eat'. I ate in the restaurant twice it was that good. I just wanted to try a little bit of everything. It's like a buffet style counter where you can choose whatever you like, honestly it's amazing and the restaurant is clean. I am only in Amsterdam for a few days but I guarantee, I will be visiting iBoenda a second and hopefully a third time again before I leave. I hope my mum won't ever get to read this as she doesn't use the internet, but as much as I love her Indonesian cooking, this Indonesian restaurant is far better and that is saying something, because I love my mum's cooking. If you miss Indonesian food, or whether you have never tried it, I absolutely recommend you eat in and get a take away too as you will not be disappointed with the food and price. Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Thank you to the lady on the train that recommended this restaurant/take away. I will make sure when I next visit Amsterdam, one of the first places to come will be iBoenda. Pity there isn't an iBoenda in the UK, they'd make an absolute killing!"",""published_at"":""8 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-04-13T02:34:54"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOpJ2puzyEa0DGLsmcOkgk7EBZDufBDFw50sEFA=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN2XyMbWwp_oQBz85s7cWiCwqbMac-FCSxAlzpI=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyd0tmSGpBRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Ahmed Zarei"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117986952106699129893?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Very delicious authentic Indonesian food the portion comparing to price was very reasonable\nVery recommended "",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-12T21:17:25"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMRidRnh0WyojVpUbJBjN4mDo3tfnHyXpbLr8Cm=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMSirGU5F3jo1y12_TU6K5J_DL8U1WstEPbB6fm=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM3BMWmJnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Idfi Pancani"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110270366568079481330?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Authentic Indonesian food.

The only thing I didn't like is that tables are very close and it can be a little uncomfortable."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-25T01:03:09"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hello Andres, thank you for the fantastic review and for sharing your experience at Salmuera!

I am really amazed by the drinks menu, especially because the cocktails section is incredibly wide, from most-loved traditionals to signature house blends. It captures your heart the minute you see the location, just by a canal and sitting by the window, you can't help but feel romantic. The interior is gorgeously decorated and branded with great attention to details but it is so subtle that it doesn't bother you, instead it is artistic. The food is also influenced by this artistic spririt. From the tableware to cutlery, from drinks to food garnishing, everything is on point. The service is incredible, handsome people attending to your dining experience with great care, what more can I ask for? I have marked Larette with a big heart on my map, I can't wait for my next evening of dining and drinking here "",""published_at"":""2 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2022-08-02T08:36:18"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":5,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNNVvahT65gfDDfKHbTr2yGvr6b7OyvmooMtm7l=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOuVf51t4TR-CnhkrrLNvUCkO8s4jFsDNEU_pXD=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNViUbRNVW3wnwsJoBVnerRN1yoNFfwV9L_1wFo=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipODAiiz1kKSHhZYgAvHzqIlMpQPQu4h2YhEs71O=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMrRSui3xGmQKmgVzEwMFuCX205OwgTsUuuW-y0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNuC6xCmV2HUL7PR_BrtqssJ2A9fJU9crTsfWV5=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOKd2cm5MdYSAFSPXC8N3TX5d5m55z0rlz0eA8X=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMp8LoQ4kULtREJ6YYk5NvpYyI7-8E5_Rf_2gHk=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMHpRREwUp7B9wIAraxPie3KZuZgKGw56DgpDX0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNGW5LK7ehwhlpEDKZrAT5tTZkmr1qoPp6yx7Ra=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOakWkgVY3hH8GcYb-9wWWWFHJLqDMAo2XbVV19=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMjMFtbvEkxeVPIdLpVAJ5kh0C5_qNClE7Bgsp3=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPkbD1mIqC_ie391CyWLykv2qIWGao80vzep02q=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPOj2C9oAXgWeKUENHm6H-wz1_jeGHg2VSxL0qa=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOj2ZClhLBst_ZH_XR2YXm54b4JDCRKeQF8uwrb=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMV3AiE6k3OCJRxhqR_jWVm_pDNVSzn60jkr4il=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP17GCxVeuIG68kJQSJArLtki-CRvhNRp9bCdXw=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNDJsGF32CR9dmcy3ZlGWHJLCaD001_h58Y_zRF=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP1SAciangpd7pyCUXZVvk5BVPFnXhhgX62I2aM=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNU5twO578Q9FeeQwLCYUrbOGDpsHboXrIBMBsk=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM-CLqS7stc2wSULnFsuzn0O32McrPWwynrfhel=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNgMlL4E_kkAtUOqD9AFpIx44FZBgO9m555g_Bg=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOFv3pUsirTgGbKXVxYW9_zGIUKrrTScy47c7lx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO5wzAsrPq5kJbWrX5j_BaXHfUpNtxrGhZw9OWA=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMJne6Ivd394wM60cXFin51Ka1urAm_AP1D016k=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN63JsK7ENNUAurCEhYvtmuA6V-srAUbr0PjD4O=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMQeTgtaGyKkkHHf6ExIsYIbP5VvT2G9D5MBK-_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOd5uU3Lmx23mh6zrsGgKh1_voZEQYFmatN3_xt=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNcdcL868xjS7B6eHk868z4ml86Y7d6aMKO_DrQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMsHX-Y_yBMXD6z5IblrXOpNn-5eJe3CBhAgcrY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPL_uF0ZCAku5kncb_vqG60bqv6xtx-4WGTZWtU=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPFEsxVMRqG4QL9MeVXWNRCrE47jnwF9gs9qamT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMYXoBIf0YVHJ2R4hnKlUElaOFKOpEnwGFe565n=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzNDVYTHR3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""F Zijlstra"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106724964382867024125?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Very friendly staff.

Delicious modern Mexican food to enjoy by yourself or with friends/loved ones, nice drinks, good vibes, friendly and amazing personnel! I do recommend to make a reservation online just in case, just to make sure that you have a table reserved.\n\nTo start of I had the TACOS DE CAMARONES (2) with shrimp, chipotle crema topped with red cabbage and samphire. It was an flavour bomb!\nSo good! The balance of flavours was spot on!\n\nAfter that I had the SERE DE PESCADO\nPan, a fried corvina in a red coconut sauce.\nA Caribbean Mexican dish from the Garifuna community. It was soooo good!\nThe fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce just elevated the entire dish! The freshly baked bread that they also serve with the dish is great to scoop up all that tasty goodness off the plate.\n\nFor my 3rd meal I had the TACOS DE SUADERO (4), a Mexico City classic. Crispy fried beef brisket with a tomatillo salsa. It was tasty, and good hit of salt... although a bit oily (but that's just my personal opinion). The lime definitely helped to add some acidity to counter the saltiness and oily flavour.\n\nTo finish it off I had the caramel flan for dessert with a cappuccino + almond syrup on the side.\nA nice and sweet way to finish off the food experience!\n\nWould I recommend this place and come back in the future?

You walk in through a narrow corridor, past a small bar and into the main area of the restaurant which has a modern 1920s vibe with satin lounges, as well as tables. To the right there is a huge open kitchen  where you can watch the kitchen staff prepare your meal. Service was very good! Attentive, friendly but not annoying. Empty plates were removed almost instantly and we could order quickly aswell. The food was DELICIOUS! All veggie and vegan and the concept allows to share. We had the mushroom tacos which were super tasty, the cauliflower wings (also great) and (the cherry on top) roasted Yacon with mole sauce. The Yacon really surprised me! The mix of the rather crisp and sweet tasting root mixed with the roasted aroma and the mole was perfect! Never had this before and I was definitely impressed!!\nThey also have their own Madre blond (in collaboration with Homeland Brewery) which tastes exotic and fresh and complements the dishes very well.\nWe spent 60EU in total and were saturated and satisfied.

They don't serve it with a sauce anymore, these days you get a squirt of Hoisin on top. Which is wrong on so many levels. The noodles taste of absolutely nothing. I think in a scheme of increasing g profit they opted for a cheap wheat noodle that is thick and filling but lacks taste and texture. I'd give the noodles a -4 that's how bad they are. The rice must be a cheap rice, no whole grains and feels like there are pieces of plastic in it. Really bad meal. Price quality not worth mentioning, as I don't recommend you visit this place.

You explicitly order two burgers and waiter brings you one, forgetting about second.

Ordered a Mini Nacho and this was the first time i got nachos where no quacamole was part of the basic order. I wrongly assumed the extra's you could add where on top off but now i had a (a few) chips and cheddar with little bean and tomatos. A LOT of jalapenos though.  Also the tipping option on the payment terminal was a surprise for me so i accidentaly tipped 5 euro.

Overall I like the ambiance, the drinks and certain dishes. However i think it is a bit pricey for the experience you have. With some improvements in service speed and spacing between tables, it has the potential to be an even more enjoyable dining spot."",""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-03-10T16:23:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNWcGVVQWWuNLB2unv3H4w5E7cXb6WjFl-ETbEj=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMjUcROfASsIeL5PXW09FMvABGbnZxNJu6R_HXY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN9dX8jXINApWoPBknc51aUHU5lcJSkLkekUgC3=s1024""]}]",,mexican restaurants in amsterdam

The market has food for everyone. Mainly for fans of asian cuisine but also Italian, Mexican and my favorite, the Snackbear \n\nTheir flammkuchen are looking (and tasting) fire pookie! The grilled spicey veggie burger is great, so are the fries and the milkshake was fresh and fruity. Definitely recommend it.\n\nOnly the Mexican food looked a bit overpriced, 3 small tacos that looked a bit sad. Didn't try it though, don't take my word for it!\n\nOfcourse, prices are high, but it's Amsterdam Business Districted so that's to be expected. For EU20-25 you can get a delicious and tasty meal with a drink + small dessert.

For just 19 euros, we got to try three types of tacos, a quesadilla, and a chocolate-filled churro to top it off.

The quesadilla with beef stew was super flavorful, and I couldn't get enough of the rich, cheesy filling paired with the consome. To end the meal, the churro was perfectly crispy with a gooey chocolate center.

We visited in the early afternoon and the restaurant was empty-ish. It was a cold and rainy day so we were glad for the warmth. Caramel waffles on the table waiting...can be eaten (at a charge lol). Service was okay...given the restaurant wasn't full, they weren't very attentive BUT when we were served the service was pleasant and warm and they were able to time stamp us so we knew when to expect our food. What was nice was that when we paid our bill, there wasn't a rush to get us out the door as some establishments like to do. I had the apple and cinnamon pancake and added banana slices. Pancake came out warm and the cream was the real deal :) if you're local to Centraal looking for a quick bite, I would definitely recommend"",""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-30T21:44:12"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPnRDDTghQPjOmf9N15A9FPq_-5GYoMYAp3Hgm3=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMcADcMJmlNuWMyMXf3rq6toyg1o829OOt7HiYa=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNDS7CJ7PmD1NtFr46EkeK0eoYNJoywxnN69YGU=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM6jJTCHqL4pgqQP8ljgKvJuUynk0uTvPIH3dZX=s1024""]}]",,mexican restaurants in amsterdam

The bartenders are skilled in making very strong cocktails and their signature one is a frozen margarita that is in a machine that they keep on all night long. They also have their famous Taco Tuesday's same as in the US, when they make 2 extra taco's at a cheaper price than usual. Also they have a monthly taco that they change from time to time. The interior is very colorful and playfull. On the back of the bar there is a wide selection of different types of liquor.

We were sitting from 7-10pm and you are annoyed by cleaning stuff around you and smell of the market. Sitting inside it's better option but super small place. Average cocktail is 10-15 eur, that's typical Dutch price. They have frozen Margaritas 1 L, wondering who is ordering this since after 5 mins when is melted it's not drinkable.

A limited no thrills menu that focuses on flavor and affordability that serves corn tortillas. You cant even buy corn tortillas in the grocery stores in the Netherlands, so you know its fresh made here.\nWith the weekend specials being priced at 3euros per taco, this is the most affordable taco in Amsterdam, yet some of the best around. The only downside is that there is no mixing and matching tacos so you end up ordering a lot to try it all, or just come back another time if you dont want to stuff yourself.\nIf you want help deciding what to order, then pork carnitas are a good option, the veggie ones were great, but a bit saucy. I find in general, birria is a bit of an overhyped taco but I will say its good here. The chips and guacamole were Excellent and stood out.\nA true mexican drink that not all taquerias have but is available here is the Horchata.

4/5 \n- Enchilada: 5+/5 \n- Burrito: 5/5 \n- Taco: 4/5 \n- Nachos Sonora: 4/5 \nPrice: 4/5 \nService: 4/5 \n\nOn my second visit to this establishment, I found that the ambiance and service continued to be fairly standard - nothing particularly noteworthy, but comfortable enough for a casual dining experience.\n\nThe highlight here is unquestionably the food, which stands a notch above the ordinary. We started with the Nachos Sonora, which, while bursting with flavor, fell short in portion size, especially as a dish advertised for two. The toppings, too, were on the scantier side, which was a bit of a letdown.\n\nMoving on to the main course, the Combinacion Alfonso's was a mixed bag. The taco was average, failing to make much of an impression. However, the enchilada and burrito were a different story altogether - absolutely divine. These dishes alone make the restaurant worth visiting, elevating the overall culinary experience.\n\nSo, while it doesn't quite hit the five-star mark for me, it's definitely a solid choice for good food. I'll surely be back, and I'd recommend giving it a try if you're in the mood for some tasty Mexican cuisine with a few standout dishes."",""published_at"":""11 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-01-17T14:05:56"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you very much for the visit and kind words.

From Mexico to Amsterdam
How it all came to be...

It all started in 2001 when Los Pilones opened the doors at Kerkstraat 63 and introduced authentic Mexican cuisine in The Netherlands!

Los Pilones is a Mexican cantina style concept, serving fresh home made food and drinks in a colourful and vibrant atmosphere - a fiesta straight from Mexico to Amsterdam. You can drop in for tacos, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, fresh margaritas, micheladas, over 200 different kinds of 100% agave tequilas and mezcal.

Pilon in Mexico means ""a little extra"" and that is exactly what we intend to give you when you visit Los Pilones!",1742,4.3,"[{""name"":""Tacos &

a 10 mins tram ride away from Amsterdam Central, The restaurant is at a good location with lot of other restaurants around it as well. As we entered the restaurant we really liked the vibes. Songs with cool beats in the background, nice friendly ambiance, perfect for the evenings for sure. In drinks we ordered Mexican beer Dos Equis and Margarita Miss Picantona. From the bites we ordered Jalapeno poppers and Totopos. The bites were really yummy and we enjoyed them with the drinks. We then ordered Tacos (chicken and veg), it was also really nice in taste. For the next round of drinks we ordered Michelada Special (beer + tequila)  and it was really great as well. The staff at the restaurant is very friendly and always happy to help with the menu. Overall a good experience and worth going in the evenings. Good to have reservation as it can get busy.\n\nPS: Although, must add that we found the place a relatively pricey as compared to other restaurants. The food is quite overpriced."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-06-30T07:36:18"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN0btJAO2_eDsnrzvUaU-xrJ7mP2JvHEWo3nD6u=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPWNoEzYJHiRfrxHiycqdcNcxhRVvY8fJVDk7I_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOChBVyydwssMAZGJInoc1QFKHb_3TwfTHKAAea=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNDv9jaavA2Iac0ygTh4jcXM7gP25dqCP5KG99_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP-MWavCKPl1IoUAJt_Q-2tLe85tjwysRexOoDQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNx46f-3ejoZ_8FRHfRi2j7Xtir_-EPlcmKmbEk=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPK-KwDLZaq3mFQrQ5QHOTHNASZEfUx8C9kZOhy=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzeWFXVmh3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Anna Tulkis"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113033021691749413262?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Great restaurant!

In my opinion there are 3 main ingredients: broth, meat, and pasta, and  I had kinda weird experience, pasta was really hot to eat, broth was warm and toppings cold, that makes me think that it was microwaved, also after we ordered plate was ready in max 3 minutes.\nBroth taste ok, but i felt it was a bit too thick compared to the taste.\nPasta was difficult to eat because it was twisted, after a few minutes it became soft, and to the taste it felt like it was not homemade pasta but the pre made from the store.\nAnd as i've mentioned earlier, meat and other toppins was cold.\nI could not give more than 2 stars."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-19T16:33:27"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPaMyOcr-6NmIntIVIoWhXRlXzwtO_wf9hYSv7H=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzeS1LSzB3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Arina S"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108072746501179241882?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Very nice place.

For the main dishes, I ordered the pumpkin ravioli which was okay and the steak -we had to return it because it was undercooked on one end- but they quickly prepared us another one and it was delicious.

Like many other reviewers on Yelp, we had a hotel credit to use and we eagerly planned to use it at this restaurant.\n\nWe made a reservation at 8 and it was not full in the restaurant yet we barely had any staff wait on us. We ordered the calamari (not pictured), short rib, broccolini and cauliflower. While we saw the manager come out multiple time to check in other tables, multiple times our food came out from the kitchen and I watched it sit there and not be brought to us. Consequently, when our short rib was finally brought to us it had been sitting for five minutes and was inedible. We do not waste food and my husband I left more than half of the short rib on the plate. When our waitress cleared our table it was quite awkward because she did not even comment or ask how our meal was.\n\nAfter we paid and left, we spoke to the Kimpton DeWitt team and asked to give feedback on our experience. All credit to the wonderful staff at the Kimpton who heard us, speedily got the manager (who was the same waitstaff who did not check in with us) and rectified the experience. When we spoke to Jasper, the manager at Celia's that evening, he heard us and said repeatedly it was not their intention while not offering any rectification for our subpar experience.\n\nI want to contrast that experience with our breakfast experience the next day at Celia. We had Evalina (name, spelling?) who was so thoughtful and engaged with all customers who came in. So much so that even when I sneezed she was right there saying bless you. She treated every customer with courtesy and respect. When we asked her her name she shook our hand and asked us if we wanted any drinks to go too. Service like that (mind you on a busy morning with the buffet) was such a stark contrast from our slow Sunday dinner experience. I want to make sure other diners are aware of the inconsistencies and the areas where the restaurant could improve."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-08T23:13:30"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOd5m7oawDzKqQTbCB5oTRZB9PLUb1d-vTkfOyO=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQblllS1RREAE"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Dan Thompson"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109826952670419327272?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Food was incredible, the best burger I've had in years.

I had it medium well and it turned out tender and juicy, which is perfect for me. It's tasty but not metallic nor bloody.\n\nAnother dish ordered was a grilled Salmon. The grilled king prawns that come with it are not dry and tasty with a dash of spice.  And the prawns tasted sweet.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall I give this restaurant a full 5 stars.\n\nThe red meat goes well with their glass of red wine.

The portions were modest, but the flavors were underwhelming, leaving me feeling disappointed, especially considering how expensive it was. I have experienced better Mediterranean cuisine at a fraction of the cost elsewhere.\n\nWhile the atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant and the staff polite, the food itself just didn't justify the high prices.

ChIJh-DyXbgJxkcRGnRS8SjYNhg,De Burgerfabriek,Hamburger restaurant,"You can find us in one of the most international known neighbourhoods of Amsterdam, ""The red light district"", an area full of history and controversy, which has been changing rapidly the last years, evolving into an eclectic mixture of local flavours and foreign cultures, where past and tradition meet future and avant-garde.

The concept of Burgerfabriek is a combination of old essence in a contemporary suit.

We come back to basics: fresh, fast, flavourful food pimped with a modern twist. An industrial and rough, but cushy space; and a kitchen based on organic, primary, quality ingredients, with a touch of sophistication

Burgerfabriek features also comfortable tables where you can tap your own beer.

The hollandaise sauce was delicate and not too thick, the bacon was cooked perfectly (not too soggy and not too crunchy) and the eggs were perfectly runny.

Two weeks ago, I had a margarita, a dark-n-stormy, and a bloody mary on the terrace, and the drinks were fantastic as usual. However, my experience took a downturn when it came to paying the bill. Due to the busy evening, the waitress took a while to bring the check, and in my hurry, I paid without closely checking the amount on the mobile payment terminal. The next morning, I realized I had been charged EU52.58 instead of the expected EU34.50, overpaying by EU18.08. When I returned the next day to resolve the issue, I was met with unhelpfulness and rudeness. The lady who attended to me (Maria) was argumentative and unwilling to listen. Despite having the exact timestamp from my bank card, she refused to check the cash register and did not offer any apology or attempt to understand my concern. I wrote an email, waited over a week, and received no reply. The lack of customer service and unwillingness to address a clear overcharge left me very disappointed. While I understand mistakes happen, the handling of this issue was entirely unsatisfactory. I think I lost my favorite spot and will not return.

I was impressed to find such a full offering of Colombian food in Amsterdam. I ordered the 3-piece portion of Empanadas, I like beef best but they also offer chicken and cheese. We then got the Bandeja Paisa, a side order of Fried Yucca and to drink Agua de Panela con limon (Sugar Cane with Lemon) juice, all in my pictures.\n\nCloser look at La Bandeja Paisa: white rice, big Colombian Beans, arepa, fried pork rind, plantain, chorizo and cow meat with avocado.\n\nIf you've never had the food or visited the country this is your chance right in Amsterdam , right in the Secret Village! I'm Colombian-American and I tell you they pass the test in quality and taste, enjoy!"",""published_at"":""3 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2021-08-22T09:09:46"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNldfDPddo4Dih8CWJs_ObReh_QpOHdYBDGWi_8=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNIBYZz68dVln3XNNqteiqvQb3a25cY9A9ltz6y=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPUlQy8kM47OToawD885oY1SEQb4pq_yXXEPT68=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNQW5gk-AKa-BLyD20B2yl3l8Q7hXtHKxgC7ejR=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO90wUfhozxKViB1IwISTkiV0yux_1uRHDQtcTt=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNjGs3BHuRGRjAf1H-5WuJVJvKle3k5J0031moB=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO79kM0D4gOARvkihVQ5AncQQKRwihwmw0B7wP7=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteGIyUzh3RRAB"",""rating"":1,""name"":""Brian Roehl"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116852393032831788906?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Calentado was not good.

The working crew were also nice. However, apparently the pub is really horrible at vetting their security people. We went 3-4 hours early today to watch Euro 2024 final and got a small table for us to have a view of a big TV etc. One member of the party was going to join later in the middle of the game. However, when she arrived, the security did not let her in and told her there is no space, even as she told we have kept a space for her at our table. Eventually one of us went to explain that we have kept her space to the security gentlemen, instead the moment he mentioned it, without any discussions the security physically grabbed him and kicked him out of the pub area, out of nowhere! Living in Amsterdam and being a frequent visitor to this pub this treatment was a big shock to my friend and instead of calling the police officer passing nearby for being subjected to physical violence, all he did was calling me to not forget his backpack. The whole party had to leave mid-game to join the two friends who were stuck outside, which is obviously not ideal when you're watching a final. Fortunately I recorded the faces of the two rude, violent and ready-to-get physical security gentlemen, which is in the attached 3-seconds video. Honestly if I was not a visitor in this country I would have followed up with police about this incident."",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-14T22:33:33"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey Azarakhsh, sorry to hear about the incident you've encountered.

extremely central. We came here for an early dinner on Boxing Day with two adults and a child.\n\nWe ordered Jalapeno Poppers, Fajitas, Chicken Wings and drinks. Everything was served within an acceptable time frame and even though we only ordered one main dish, nobody looked at us in a funny way or made us feel less welcome.\n\nThe food was great. It's of course not the top tier authentic Mexican cuisine you'll find here, but we found everything to be delicious and tasty measured by European Mexican restaurant standards. Saying this is more of an Indian restaurant cause the food is spicy is nothing but ridiculous. Educate yourself before making a fool of yourself on the internet.\n\nThe prices at this restaurant are nearly unbeatable. Main courses come at around EU18 per dish, starters are EU8-10. You can eat much worse for much more money when you're in Amsterdam, especially around the Dam.\n\nThe service could be a lot more friendly aha welcoming, that much I'll give you critical people. But we were still treated with respect and never felt unwelcome or overlooked.\n\nWe'd come here again any given time.

We (Australians) found this Mexican / Argentina restaurat to be one of the best we have eaten at.\n\nMaybe this restaurant thrives on the Ballet & Opera evening show dinners and on NYE there was no evening show, hence why we may have been the only diners.

She was incredibly polite and promptly checked with the chef manager in the kitchen.\n\nTo my utter shock, the Italian chef came out and began yelling at me, insisting that nothing could be done about my mistake. He continued to scream, even as I stood there in disbelief at his reaction. I calmly asked him to stop, but he persisted. The staff, who appeared just as shocked as I was, looked on helplessly.\n\nI informed the chef that his behavior had cost them a loyal customer who had previously enjoyed many visits to Sushito. I have worked in the hospitality industry for ten years and have never encountered such unprofessional and aggressive conduct from a staff member.\n\nThis experience has completely soured my view of Sushito, and I will not be returning.  The extreme rudeness and lack of basic customer service were appalling.

We started off sitting downstairs until a table opened up upstairs.  The employees were really nice in accomodating us which was great.  Then we started off buying a pitcher of Mango margarita. Really tasty margarita.  We also started off with some nachos. It was interesting to see cucumber on nachos but the nachos taste was alright. For the main course we ordered: a chimichanga (deep fried flour tortilla filled with beef, also came with rice, beans and salad), a burrito (chicken and beef, came with rice, beans and salad), Fajita Margarita and Vegetarian Chimichanga. The meat for the Fajitas were very flavorful. The Chimichangas were solid but the size was a bit on the smaller side.

We arrived on a Saturday night after being told in other places that they were full, so finding space here was great! The waitress warned us that the dishes were coming slowly and we accepted the condition. The staff was friendly and spoke Spanish although service was a bit sloppy and seemed to lack diligence.\nAfter waiting a lot for our food (we got first starters then ordered mains) everything was great! We were all very happy with the food.\nWhen we arrived I had ordered a margarita that took almost as much as the food to arrive and when it did it was salty. I (went down stairs to the bar and) asked the waitress if she could change it, she gladly did and the new one was good,    the wife of my boyfriend's brother ordered one too, although we missed the Margarita glasses (they were served in a long glass haha).\nOverall it was a good eating experience, if you are willing to be patient, we were warned about the longer times and the staff was nice to us, food was delicious and we had a great time.

Understated decor -- they could try a little harder to honest. It doesn't have a lot of personality. But it's OK. I felt comfortable here, and that's important. The staff were not massively forthcoming or enthusiastic though, which did miff me a little.\n\nI ordered a glass of red wine and a beef steak with chorizo and mustard sauce. It came with a salad and a baked potato and on the whole, it was good. The steak was excellent and the mustard sauce was even better -- it took my breath away. Literally. It was hot as a mother. The place as a whole though, was kind of bland, the waiter was not remotely engaged and the salad had one olive. I mean, come on. One olive is much more of an insult than no olives. Oh, and there were little flies flitting about, for which I did not care.\n\nOn the whole, pretty good but with lots of room for improvement.

The staff repeatedly stared at us, to the point where it felt like they were sizing us up. Before our food arrived, one staff member stood right behind my chair with his hand on it, listening in on our private conversation, which was incredibly intrusive. To make matters worse, while we were eating, I was bizarrely told to switch to another seat for no apparent reason, further disrupting the experience.\n\nWhen it came to the food, the ribs were overly sweet and sickly, and the salad looked nothing like the menu photos. While it did fill me up for the evening, the quality left much to be desired.\n\nThe final interaction was the most off-putting. When the bill arrived, the older waiter made a point of highlighting the tip section and seemed displeased when I chose not to add one. He sulked, walked away without thanking us, and didn't even say goodbye.\n\nThis restaurant has potential with its fair pricing and ambiance, but the staff's attitude and the food quality need serious improvement to make it a place worth recommending."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-19T15:32:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NWR2SHN3RRAB"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Abu Isaac"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115443352950219315272?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Food was lovely.

Food was beyond bad. Above all, Super salty. Fountain drinks had no taste just water and gas.  Other tables complaining on the salt.  The rice is completely tasteless (like Chinese white rice but painted yellow). I guess I was not expecting real Mexican food for we are in Amsterdam, but at least decent Tex-Mex. Well not even that.  You should get acquainted with flavor of the dishes before selling. Unfortunately this review is from a Mexican that has eaten Mexican Food around the globe. This is my least favorite. Guys the nachos... la sopa de frijoles... no way to rescue this review. Had not eaten all day... no even starving would recommend this place on my experience on this day. Wish the place all the best for they are hard working, but sometimes that is not enough.

For adding sauces to your fries, you pay an extra charge. Depending on the size of fries you order, the prices are different. Would it maybe be possible you had a look on the old prices shown on google and went inside with the idea of paying 3,50 euro for a portion of fries? We don't scam guests, we have a big menu with prices shown on the wall. Hopefully there was a misunderstanding about the prices because of old pictures on Google and hopefully we can serve you an other time.
