Midden in het zakelijk hart van Amsterdam vind je ons in een licht en modern restaurant aan het water. Een populaire plek waar je heerlijk kunt borrelen en eten. Vanaf ons terras heb je een mooi uitzicht over de gracht van de Boelelaan. Perfect voor een zakenlunch of om de week gezellig af te sluiten met vrienden of familie.

Iedereen weet; de beste biefstuk van Amsterdam eet je bij Loetje. Deze serveren we al ruim 45 jaar op onze eigen no-nonsense manier, in jus en met zacht witbrood. Daarnaast is de steak tartaar een echte blijmaker, maar ook onze kipsate, hamburger en biefstuk 0.0 zijn succesnummers op de menukaart.

The restaurant itself looks modern, serene. Staff is friendly and as soon as we were seated the first small bites arrived. Most of the menu is based around vegetables because the restaurant has its own garden at the busy Zuidas. We had a three course lunch menu with the first two courses being vegetables and the final course fish. I found the taste sometimes a bit blend. Missing not only seasoning but an exciting sauce to get a bit more flavor differences out of the vegs.\n\nThe restaurant has a terrace and staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The wine was great and they also have a juice menu. All in all for me the rating gets three stars because of the combination between the (personal) bit blend flavors and price.

I cannot give 5 stars and recommend it to my friends only because of it, I hope they will improve their service."",""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-02-23T14:34:42"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":2,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPaNQtS_15fOVUxKnerql7i73CN8iXyWm9Dpg9_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMEzUP3L0lxMwfcqt9MECOCxTO3I6sjcpkZgwgF=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO_MM0YT48TOHI0A5Ucc9WB3cq0199u7ut3sZns=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOu77OunwaK9AH1TE6S6JozrbjR0xSyJ0xej6Mn=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOAxuMIoqW-32xJUMGhd_YAMFkc4YTM-FZNJGqv=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPqyRtoKnKvBvC6r73lG749ZYZgHXwGvhEAzo06=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0ejlDb1dBEAE"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Jovana"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100994967980592099505?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""The place is nicely decorated with minimalistic style. However, the overall experience leaves one 'confused', for a lack of a better word. The ingredients are certainly very fresh and you can tell lots of thought went into dishes but the taste is mediocre. I can't say that I'd like to have any of the dishes again. Scallops, for example, were tasty, but the sauce that was paired with them didn't go well - making the whole dish unable to live to its potential. The ice cream with liquorish was an interesting presentation but it just wasn't tasty. The selection of wines and service was good. Overall, interesting experience but for this level of restaurant the dishes should be much more sharp."",""published_at"":""11 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-02-08T09:57:29"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMKhdcEgSPLUTtsIAM3amheQGgL5lvlnbCDPVxz=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOqGKbh_uuVTqEGPMvLXKGrQXMGH-pK7tf44BJ9=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNokIK76oFxXOdwqg14Hdga4_zB_yarKq0NavxM=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPzu_hazElI6bjfDjE8DhABz0WiYJiT_VmunI8j=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPZai-y3DSthDEc-helQn5H7I0B44whDdMNqlwD=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPsQngbzQTes5it3B8ij_FzO_GbUp6iIMNGuYI9=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKcjdOThAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""L A"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114335872713280150594?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Fab lunch experience, starting by welcome and dishes descriptions.

We had vegan croquettes as an appetizer and they were nice but again, nothing too special. As a main course we had the roasted cauliflower, which was a bit over spiced for my taste and the fish soup. Firstly, the two things did not harmonize at all, which is not necessarily the restaurants fault but I do think the staff should be able to recommend or comment on this, given that it's a shared dining concept.\nThe fish soup with mussels was good in taste and with plenty seafood in there.\nService was friendly and attentive but it took very long for the food to arrive and to shift from starter to main course even though it was not really that busy.\nOverall I can say it was good but nothing too special and for the prices I think it's not be best value for money."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-09T06:01:40"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM6fIL_3DmU1GQ9TGL7HKbXcqQPlMxsmXdf06AN=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6LW9LYV9BRRAB"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Theo Veltman"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115030959655245323636?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""We went for a Dim Sum Sunday.

It was a Monday night, pretty dead and the service from the server was not great, we rarely got checked on by her and we would have ordered more drinks if she had. We chose the 4 course chefs choice. The first two courses were really rich and could have been shared by two people - the buratta was covered in a really sweet jam and it was too much with the rich flavor of the buratta. The tartar was also very rich and could have been shared, the balance was off and the richness could have been offset\nwith something else. Our main course was the most delicious, a perfectly tender and tasty pork. That made it more worth while. The desert was good, but I can't remember what it was now... it fell a little flat for us. A bit disappointed for the reviews and being recommended by the Michelin guide."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-09-15T09:48:54"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":2,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNkAGJYS50enGJiXqiY7oEWJcpzAJpfTwH4o2Ne=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNmH1FUVl6R8VGUZHP45VZBvdziYHQN78oCRj_0=s1024""]}]",[],restaurants amsterdam zuid
ChIJ4cQymvEJxkcR7DCtnd76R0Q,Cafe Loetje,"De plek waar het ruim 45 jaar geleden allemaal is begonnen: Loetje Amsterdam Cafe aan de Johannes Vermeerstraat in Amsterdam Zuid. In 1977 door Ludwig 'Loetje' Klinkhamer opgericht als biljartcafe. Toen de inmiddels beroemde ossenhaasbiefstuk op het menu kwam, verdwenen de biljarttafels al snel naar de achtergrond en werd hier geschiedenis geschreven.

Tegenwoordig kun je nog steeds elke dag bij Loetje Amsterdam Cafe genieten van de lekkerste biefstuk van Amsterdam. Bij ons geniet je van het vertrouwde biefstukreceptuur en het warme Loetje DNA. Bij ons zit je naast deze klassieker ook goed voor vis, vegetarisch en overheerlijke toetjes. Zien we je snel?

I recently visited for a morning meal and found the experience to be pleasant\n\nThe menu features a mix of classic and creative breakfast options. I opted for the brioche bread with jam and butter, which was a good choice. The Cilbir poached eggs caught my eye with their Turkish-inspired twist, adding an interesting flavor profile to the meal. To round things out, I enjoyed a cup of coffee and a refreshing jar of juice.\n\nWhile the food was satisfactory, it didn't quite reach the heights of extraordinary. The flavors were good, but perhaps lacked that special something to make them truly memorable. That said, the quality was certainly there, and I appreciated the effort to incorporate diverse influences into the menu.\n\nOne thing to note is the restaurant's size. Dignita Vondelpark is quite small and tends to get packed quickly. I'd strongly recommend making a reservation to avoid disappointment.\n\nThe atmosphere is intimate, which can be charming but may feel a bit cramped when busy. However, this does contribute to a lively, bustling vibe that some diners might enjoy.\n\nOverall, Dignita Vondelpark provides a decent breakfast experience in a prime location."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-24T08:44:31"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey Ahmad, thanks for taking the time to share your detailed thoughts on Dignita Vondelpark!

The atmosphere and service were ten out of ten. Unfortunately, the food wasn't that tasty as there was a lot of sauce in the dishes and the quality wasn't convincing. For example, the nigiri had a very basic and not tasty rice and the fried chicken had a small piece of bone. The food was also too salty for our personal taste. On the other hand, the cocktails were very interesting and tasty. All in all, if you like tapas in general, I would recommend this restaurant for its interesting concept and warm, welcoming atmosphere and fair prices, but don't expect super quality food."",""published_at"":""2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-28T15:52:12"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5eDhxbXNBRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Charlotte Zeilstra"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114613213479974023119?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Went here for dinner with friends and all the food was very delicious.

Some of the best burgers of our lifetimes! I ordered the Back to Kansas burger (Black Angus beef, cheddar cheese, the Burger Room sauce, romaine lettuce, no tomato), Oz Rings, and the Yellow Brick Road cocktail (their own proprietary Limoncello). My daughter ordered The Scarecrow burger (Black Angus, bacon, cheddar cheese, carmelized onion, pickle, remaine, no tomato) with fries, and the Kan Niet Heksen cocktail (the burger rum blend, ginger, spekkoek, and lime). And for dessert, the Melted Wicked Witch Freakshake - not for the faint at heart!\n\nWhile you are there be sure to follow the yellow brick road to the bathroom in the lower level. The Oz theme continues with green and gold sinks, mirrors and walls.

To summarize, it didn't feel very clean, especially the kitchen and the floors, which is an open kitchen by the way. While I was trying to take some photos, someone told me I couldn't take pictures of the kitchen. Having an open kitchen and then telling customers not to photograph it is a big contradiction in my opinion, and a bit absurd. But of course, it's the establishment's rule, so I respect that.\n\nI'm not a fan of mixed omelets, so I played it safe and ordered scrambled eggs with sausages. However, plain scrambled eggs came with mushrooms in them.

While the food was enjoyable, the service left much to be desired.\n\nLet's start with the positives. The food at Lokaal van de Stad was undeniably delicious. I tried their seafood risotto, and the flavors were rich and well-balanced. The seafood was fresh, and the dish was cooked to perfection. Additionally, their dessert menu offered a variety of tempting options, and the chocolate lava cake I ordered was decadent and satisfying.\n\nHowever, my dining experience was marred by the subpar service. The staff seemed disorganized and inattentive, often forgetting to bring requested items and taking an excessively long time to attend to our table. It was frustrating to have to repeatedly ask for water refills and wait extended periods for our orders to be taken.\n\nMoreover, the lack of communication between the waitstaff and the kitchen resulted in some mistakes with our orders. One of our appetizers arrived much later than the others, and one of the main courses had to be sent back because it was undercooked. These issues could have been avoided with better coordination and attention to detail.\n\nDespite the service shortcomings, I must commend the kitchen staff for their culinary skills. The food itself was the saving grace of my dining experience at Lokaal van de Stad. However, the lack of attentive service left a sour taste in my mouth and prevented me from fully enjoying what could have been an outstanding meal.\n\nIn conclusion, while Lokaal van de Stad showcased culinary prowess, the disappointing service experience significantly impacted my overall impression. I hope they address the service issues and improve their front-of-house operations to match the quality of their food."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-06-28T16:11:10"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":5,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOk-d06sBpQT4EKzMZ1caTKrJ-6Rkr5m2tSgy8M=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO7yBHPUFc4C1XvHX797geul8IlcDxmSXfcFXlq=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP2FhOdT1rFZNKvSAEWWxduJfMH0U4bnTMrMi5x=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMUguFak_n3dKS-vRhg1IZ9ickLaO7xBac7zlBt=s1024""]}]",[],restaurants amsterdam zuid

The music is a little loud at times, but you can speak over it.\n\nThe open kitchen is fun to watch and adds to the uniqueness of the restaurant.\n\nThe food is fancy, cooked to perfection, presented well and unusual. Portions are very small. They suggest you buy courses and share, but I guess this works better if you are not a vegetarian visiting with a large group of meat eaters. Very small portions and missing out on courses meant I left hungry. My fault, I didn't want to draw attention to it.\n\nHowever it was a special treat to visit there, not somewhere I would have chosen myself. The host was very theatrical and told a story with every dish placed on the table. He was knowledgeable, entertaining and fun.  He was scuppered a little by the other server who initially started placing all the wrong dishes on our table and then later placed dishes before he was ready and he didn't get to do his thing.\n\nI'm glad I got to visit and it was a great evening."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-10-14T15:43:08"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":2,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOUO2y53ztDsuQ33FGXlFCFAyNDWeKk2vbomcu0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPtJK8SxNbJT1z4IljDjMnmuea-uZnxquqckJdp=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOdpwPV61FfkRZqQTV66pAnu-B7CXjZ7Sildivu=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPawzV1YEtFJBRcyiGH1-397MhBVTk-8PRVK7-A=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPOK4Zeo_LG1a1OyfZldAZFZ_qZgi1S8VTpcpEw=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPGceEOWcvCVA_LwAndHSNcNINP43yozxjQhEg_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNu-lGjSZpXqNvtnBZsoqD0Ej8H3lf4n9Y8ux0s=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMggwlAYNpsaEM_2MjM4OtuJnL4e_-kmUavH9Pn=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPRHj2M0TgRvhw_ZBoAKy_mOCvI-vWndL3ZFHaZ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNX6ujLSyNaj9_FBPZbf5kxNV96eRNe6hs-eBCl=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPhuKsDHgOT29-XrpgcR9uPskp2EXKQy4b-MKht=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPQjWTI1guZCWstciURGEPAoL7BlXrSbtqZHsS8=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYOU1PVnVRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""S T"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112296306183852419942?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Always great service & very professional.

The market has food for everyone. Mainly for fans of asian cuisine but also Italian, Mexican and my favorite, the Snackbear \n\nTheir flammkuchen are looking (and tasting) fire pookie!

Definitely recommend it.\n\nOnly the Mexican food looked a bit overpriced, 3 small tacos that looked a bit sad. Didn't try it though, don't take my word for it!\n\nOfcourse, prices are high, but it's Amsterdam Business Districted so that's to be expected. For EU20-25 you can get a delicious and tasty meal with a drink + small dessert.

The place is cozy, with beautiful design and well-maintained surroundings. The staff is friendly, which creates a positive impression.\n\nI really enjoyed the Caesar salad.

However, in my opinion, it felt a bit incomplete as a meal. Adding a salad or some extra ingredients could make it a more complete meal.\n\nOverall, we had a very positive experience at the cafe.

I explained to the waiter the background but he insisted that this is the only solution for now and otherwise I can leave! I asked why they didn't call me in advance to notify me, but they didnt have an answer.\nIt was so arrogant that two friends from the group decided to leave and join us back only for drinks later. When they came back we wanted to add two chairs to our table (as the waiter told us when we first arrived that we can try to squeeze all on a table for 6). The two friends came back only for a drink and then the waiter started to be difficult again saying we cannot add chairs, which is not in line to what he initially told us! so we eventually had to split!\nThis is another level of unprofessional service.\n\nAlso we ordered starters and then mains, they had the decency of bringing everything together.

The spaghetti was missing flavour amongst other things but it was an okay dish. The downside is that the food takes incredibly long to come out, especially considering that we were the first people at the restaurant. We then asked the waiter if she could check on our food and she said that it is coming shortly given that all the pasta is made fresh, which I understand but that is something that I would automatically be expecting if I were dining in an Italian restaurant.

The restaurant has a varied menu that caters to different tastes and dietary preferences.\n\nDuring my visit, I tried several dishes. The Eggs Florentine was well-prepared, with nicely poached eggs and a good hollandaise sauce. The spinach added a fresh element to the dish. For those looking for a lighter option, the Granola Bowl with Yogurt and fruits is a good choice. The granola had a nice crunch, and the yogurt was creamy. The fruit selection was fresh and added natural sweetness.\n\nThe French toast was enjoyable - golden on the outside and soft inside. It wasn't overly sweet, which I appreciated. The freshly squeezed orange juice was a refreshing accompaniment.\n\nCoffee drinkers will find the Americano satisfactory. It was well-brewed and complemented the meal nicely.\n\nWhat stood out was the quality of ingredients used in the dishes. The food tasted fresh, and it's clear the kitchen pays attention to the details.\n\nThe restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere, making it suitable for a relaxed breakfast or brunch. The service was attentive without being intrusive.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood and looking for a good breakfast spot, Bonnie is worth considering.\n\nI'd be happy to return and try more items from their menu.

The options from Two Chefs brewing are some of the best I've had. The Betterballs are so flavoursome, with extremely crispy outer layers that reveal a creamy, mouth-watering inside.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff went above and beyond with their friendly and helpful service.\n\nWe also had the chance to try several drinks, and the combinations were spot on - each one unique and well-crafted.\n\nAs a sweet touch, they surprised us with a dessert complete with a candle, which made my girlfriend's day even more special.

We ordered the 3-course menu, and while the first course (a mushroom with sauce) was tasty, the portions overall were far too small to satisfy anyone. The main course, which consisted of just 3 pieces of gnocchi, was particularly underwhelming--not only in size but also in taste. It resembled pancakes more than gnocchi, and I found it unappetizing.\n\nThe service was generally good, with an attentive and friendly host. However, there were a few lapses. For instance, we paid EU6 per person for unlimited bread, pickles, and water, but the four of us were initially served only 2 pieces of bread to share, which felt very odd since they make you pay for the bread.  Despite requesting more several times, it took quite a while to receive it.\n\nOverall, while the service was pleasant, the portions and flavors of the dishes left a lot to be desired.

We learned quickly that restaurants stop serving food to prep for dinner and only offer snacks or bites so that is what we got since we were starving. Tried bitterballen for the first time (pictured below). It was different, but we didn't hate it. The real star was the nachos. They were so GOOD. I am a lover of nachos and these tasted so fresh. I wish I knew where they got the chips or if they made them because they were the tastiest tortilla chips I have ever had. Definitely order those! As for service, we had a very friendly server. He seated us inside due to the patio being full but as soon as a spot opened he cleared it and moved us outside. Overall, it was a nice experience and it is a great spot to stop for a bite and to chat. We did not order an actual meal so I cannot speak on that which is why I just put 4 stars. Plus, even though it was between meals, it was still pretty busy.

We walked in (after having tried some other restaurants, but without a reservation on a Friday night...it gets difficult in Amsterdam). We were seated at the bar and gladly took it. At first I felt a bit overlooked, but our waiter quickly realized that and offered us some extra bread on the house. Normally, I wouldn't get excited about bread but the smoked almond/garlic butter they pair it with is just delicious. After a while we were even offered a table seat and continued our dinner there. The food is scrumptious!\n\nThe dishes are all prepared with care and were amazing. The wine was surprisingly well-priced and our waiters each gave us amazing warm service. Our waiter Nikos had great recommendations for the food and even for a coffee place in the morning. We felt pampered all evening. I can greatly recommend the smoked eel and foie gras, the scallops and ribeye. Don't forget to order a side of mashed potato with bone marrow- it is really good.\n\nI was even surprised about the desserts; sometimes it can be an afterthought, but at Maris Piper each dessert was well balanced and brought their own personality. The baba is light, has a rly nice orange like presence, the baked Alaska had an amazingly lemony meringue, and the chocolate was rich and dense. Beautiful!

The food, while palatable, wasn't particularly memorable, with the steak tartare being premade and most dishes overly salted. The one highlight of the evening was the impressive wine selection.\n\nThere are certainly more memorable dining experiences in the area, but this restaurant may appeal to those looking for a \""refined\"" old-money ambiance.

With two main courses ordered, only one small bowl of fries and salad was given to share between us, and if you can believe it, a large supplement charge was given (without warning!) for the extra fries. The setting was also disappointing, with the tables crammed so close together that you could not get up for the bathroom without knocking into a wine holder or your neighbour's table. This was also exacerbated by the constant banging coming from servers knocking into things as they tried to negotiate the narrow corridors between tables (not their fault!).\nAll of this drama, and I haven't even gotten to the food yet, which was a very mediocre steak tartar.

Pizza
Wij zijn De Pizzabakkers. Onze ambachtelijke pizza's worden gebakken in Italiaanse ovens. Door het complexe deegbereidingsproces is de bodem krokant, dun en vol van smaak. De pizza's worden belegd met uitsluitend verse ingredienten die we zorgvuldig kiezen. Onze worsten en hammen komen van familiebedrijven in Italie. Voor bij de pizza: frisse salades. Voor na de pizza: huisgemaakte Italiaanse toetjes.

Prosecco
Bubbels worden meestal geassocieerd met luxe, maar in Italie is prosecco een pretentieloos drankje. Wij hebben een frizzante en een spumante op de kaart en we maken er lekkere cocktails mee zoals scroppino, hugo en Aperol spritz.",,363,4.3,"[{""name"":""Pizza &

The grilled chicken (which is a dish normal folk will rarely order when out) is superb - give it a shot. Today we had the burger for the first time, and it is not surprisingly, outstanding. My wife loves the fries, but that shouldn't be a good argument when the Netherlands makes the best of them. Anyway, I read the negative comments and I can understand. They all go around being hard to get a table, or being neglected by waiters. It's a busy spot, and the NL notoriously has less waitresses than peak demand.

Promptly seated, the service was prompt and pleasant.\n\nOrdered the Eggs Benedict and a cappuccino.\n\nThe Eggs benedict was nicely done. Plating was pleasing. The hollandaise sauce was flavourful albeit a tad salty. The poached eggs was done perfectly but I wish either the hollandaise was toned down a little, or the eggs used could have been of a more flavourful variety. The ham was a bit of a let-down, too thin-cut and lacked presence. However, overall the dish is alright.\n\nThe cappuccino was OK, but wish the beans had a little more oomph.\n\nOverall, I give the cafe 5 stars.

Usually, from what I've experienced, the busy moments are between 12pm and 3pm, but afterwards (and in any case with some headphones in/on) you can just chill and focus in a quiet but nice atmosphere.\n\nThe toasties, warm drinks and smoothies here are great, and you get a lot for what you pay (my faves are the veggy toastie and dopyaza, together with their delicious chai latte). I also love that they have lots of vegan options - in terms of both drinks and food!\n\nThe only minor downside, I would say, is that the type of service is a bit ambiguous - meaning, depending on who is serving that day, it seems as if it is self-service (getting/asking for your own menu and ordering at the counter; also for second orders or when you're finished it looks like they can be a bit slow with paying attention), while it looks like a restaurant that offers table service. However, as mentioned, this isn't always the case.\n\nDespite that, the staff is in any case very nice and friendly. So everyone just goes with the flow eventually, and enjoys their time here!\n\nAll in all, still one of my fave spots now, and I (will) keep coming back!"",""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-02-20T06:59:24"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear An,\nThank you very much for sharing such a nice review.

It was so thin & full of flavour directly from Tandoor. Very few restaurants serve with fresh traditional tandoori items but this is the place. Delhi style butter chicken is simply yummylicious. Not just sweet but flavourful. don't forget to try their fresh lime soda with freshly squeezed lemon. Highly recommended.  Thank you so much!

sushi mix - buy one get one free. Regrettably, the experience was thoroughly disappointing.\n\nThe main issue was with the packaging. Both sushi sets were squeezed into one box, causing them to stick together and get damaged. It was impossible to pick up a single piece without ruining it.\n\nMoreover, when I called to provide this feedback, the response was baffling and unhelpful. They suggested I should use chopsticks, which is obvious for eating sushi, and completely missed the point of my complaint. Additionally, they refused to acknowledge the problem, insisting that they always combine two boxes into one. This contradicts my previous orders from months ago, where the packaging was appropriately done with separate boxes.\n\nThis not only shows a lack of consistency in their service but also a disregard for customer feedback. Sushi, known for its finesse and presentation, was compromised due to careless packaging. The restaurant's response to my complaint only added to the frustration."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-12-08T21:02:20"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":4,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPcf39LQjMKgJpNf3_n40AD_WY-hokzrbQ6HO-2=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN8STKHbuUmM5IqvwAx_uc4Sc4xdsMV8MMyhST7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPwAF1s8IhbvFZZm_qSyNgEH86bEWN8AiGz07UC=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2eF9UTWRnEAE"",""rating"":1,""name"":""Flor Bari"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106386571300478869587?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""The worst sushi I have ordered.It is not fresh made and the rolls are made like without any knowledge how to make sushi.

I visited was in a slight panic trying to find takeaway places to order a quick late night meal that catered for my allergens.  By that point, I'd walked around for about 30 minutes trying to find a place with no luck, until I came to Hearth on 11 Oct 2024.  They'd sadly JUST stopped food service when I arrived, but the lovely owner, Marcus, took pity on my plight and offered some excellent gluten free and vegan quinoa sushi with dressing for free.  I was amazed by his wonderful generosity that I made a point to come and visit to try the menu out properly when my friend from London arrived.\n\nAnd that we did.  We visited on Sunday 13 October as walk-ins and everything from the food (presentation and flavour) the non-alcoholic cocktails, the ambience, and the service was nothing short of amazing.  Unfortunately Marcus wasn't there the night I visited as a sit-down guest, but I did offer him one promise...this review, so I send my heartfelt gratitude for his kindness and generosity.

As a starter, I had the saganaki and for dessert, I had the oh-so-sweet limoncello tiramisu, along with a chamomile tea. During previous visits, I believe I've had the Jerusalem plate, which serves as a pretty thorough sampler as a main course.

When ordering, I decided to go for the mango lassi for drinks, the papri bites and alu tikki for starters, and the butter chicken with a side of garlic nan as a main course. Before my ordered starters, I got a complementary starter with different spicy to sweet sauces and a side of \""crackers\"". After this, I was surprised by the deliciousness of the starters, particularly of the papri bites (would strongly recommend!). The butter chicken was also quite good as the chicken was soft and juicy, the sauce was savory, and it came with some rice which was perfectly made and complemented the dish quite nicely. The side of nan elevated the dish even more in my opinion. Finally, the mango lassi was one of the best ones I have tried in my lifetime so I would strongly recommend to consider ordering it.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience with the staff, the food was quite savory, and I can't wait to go back and try more off the quite varied menu. As for the prices, the main dishes are a bit on the expensive side, however they are worth it as you do get a lot of food and it's quite high quality.

We were there to celebrate our anniversary. The waiter first confirmed our reservation and congrats to us. During the diner, the staff are friendly, checking with us is everything okay, how is the serving speed, would we like to have a chill break before having the dessert etc. Right before we left, the staff congrats us again, really sweet. Our chief is great, she is kind, keep smiling while I cannot imagine how heavy the work she is doing, constantly cooking for us for 3 hours almost.\n\nThe Atmosphere is really great too. It has soft lighting, decorated with traditional Japanese style.\n\nNow come to the most important part for me. The FOOD, it is amazing. We chose the Classic menu.\n* Started with Tuna tataki (I am too focus on the food and forgot to take picture for it). It has beautifully caramelized crust but super tender inside.\n* Then come with Seasalt crusted sea bass. The crust looks interesting too, it looks like puffed pancake, asked the chief, it is 90% salf and 10% whisked egg. The fish filet stays juicy with the Seasalt crust on top. The chief bake the fish skin separately, make it super crispy (I love chips, also fish chips)\n* The 3rd course is Canadian lobster with Yuzu garlic butter. Beside those 3 words: lobster + garlic + butter, what do we need to say more. (Spoil alert: it come with the fire show)\n* Wagyu steak is definitely the high light of the course. It come with 3 \""sauce\"", himalayan salt, Japanese wasabi and one more (I forgot the name, but that's my favorite match with the Wagyu among all 3) Its provide a bit freshness to compensate well with the grease of Waygu. Btw it come with grilled zucchini and paprika too (I love grilled vegetables!!!!) It also come with some baked Wagyu fat part too. I expect it would be crispy, but the bigger pieces is not crispy enough though (small details)\n* The Chicken fried rice served together with the Wagyu. Do not get my wrong, it is tasty too, but having it together with Wagyu, I could not finish it eventually. Personally I am not a fan of having rice together with steam\n* The desert: Sazanka pancake (Dorayaki, one my favorite sweets, I love red bean paste ) the Japanese ice cream served with it is Matcha icecream. Personally, I do not like dessert to be too sweet, so leave the syrup aside. The Dorayaki is perfect with Matcha together\n* Extra: we also got an extra dessert on the house for the Congratulation"",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-22T19:36:43"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Ruiling Zhang,\n\nThank you so much for your detailed and wonderful review of Teppanyaki Restaurant Sazanka. \n\nWe are delighted to hear that you chose to celebrate your anniversary with us and that we could contribute to making it a special occasion.\n\nWe are thrilled that you appreciated the warm welcome from our team and the attentive service throughout your dinner.

The open kitchen offers a captivating view of the culinary creations being prepared. The service is exceptional, with staff providing detailed explanations of each dish.\n* Cornettino con tartara di tonno\nThis dish consists of a crispy cone filled with tuna tartare. The tuna tartare is delicately seasoned and finely diced, offering a fresh and flavourful experience.\n* Panna cotta al porro, uova di aringa, anetto\nThis features a unique combination of flavours and textures. The \""pudding\"" is made with leeks, giving it a savoury and creamy texture similar to traditional panna cotta but with a savoury twist.\n* Cannolicchio siciliano, ricotta, gambero Mazara del vallo\nThis dish is a mini-Sicilian cannolo filled with creamy ricotta cheese and a shrimp from Mazara del Vallo. The cannolo shell is crispy, while the ricotta is rich and creamy.\n* Spaghetto n'duja pistacchio di Bronte, bottarga\nThe pasta is cooked to perfection, offering a satisfying chewiness. The addition of nduja, a spicy Calabrian sausage paste, provides a unique and bold flavour profile.\n* Filetto al pepe verde\nThis dish features beef tenderloin served with a green peppercorn sauce. The beef is incredibly tender, boasting a rich umami flavour that delights the palate.\n* Cake di mandarino con salsa di cioccolato al peperoncino\nThe cake is infused with the refreshing taste of mandarin, creating a delightful blend of citrus flavours. The addition of the chili-chocolate sauce adds a unique twist, providing a subtle heat that complements the sweetness of the cake.\nA big shout-out to Chef @Ceci! I highly recommend paying a visit to Cucina Casalinga for dinner.

However it ended up being a disappointing lunch and doubt I'll be rushing back. For a bar in Amsterdam the range of drinks on offer felt a little limited and the more common options aren't available. The mix of food on offer is a much better balance though and ideal for a lunch time meal.\n\nI opted for the burger which was served rare. So rare in fact that we debated whether it had actually been on a grill at all, and ended up being inedible. Portion size was good though and the ribs were tasty. A refill of drinks also ended up taking so long to be served that we thought it had been forgotten, only turning up once we were about to leave.

You may wait a very long time to get any additional food or drinks."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-18T22:35:11"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNehnJ_f3HnlRggYcpgOhi0k2Ha-AsJhGBmSzrx=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiMjhhZnRBRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Polina List"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112460038065762237620?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Great Indian restaurant with delicious food.

 Numa Muller, our chef from Arles, creates a new 4 and 5 course chef's menu every month (a la carte is also possible). His neo-bistro dishes are surprising because of the special combinations of French cuisine with outside influences.

 We have an entirely French wine list with an interesting composition of traditional producers, as well as emerging vins nature.

excellent service. The staff is professional, friendly, and well-informed, creating an enjoyable dining experience.\n\nHowever, I was somewhat disappointed with the food, especially considering the price. We opted for the chef's five-course tasting menu, which included three appetizers, one main course, and a dessert.\n\nThe first two appetizers were outstanding, the scallop, and the mushrooms in chestnut cream; but the third, a fried croquette, felt uninspired, with the flavor dominated entirely by the frying. The main course, featuring venison, was delicious; however, the addition of two small pieces of eel felt out of place and did not harmonize with the rest of the dish.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect, unfortunately, was the dessert. The menu included a pear-based dessert accompanied by parsley ice cream. While innovative, the flavors were peculiar and didn't align with what one would expect for a dessert course. Unsatisfied, I asked to try the second dessert option, which was cottage cheese-based. Sadly, this too failed to impress and did not feel like a fitting conclusion to an otherwise refined meal. For the price I paid I would have expected more.\n\nIn summary, while the menu shows great promise, certain elements could be improved. I would strongly recommend revisiting the dessert selection to ensure a more satisfying ending to an otherwise well-thought-out dining experience."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-18T11:51:55"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey there, Enrico Verdolotti!

So, that's good I guess, that's one. Second, the guy servicing the table looks like he does not want to work that night was having a vibe that quite honestly is off-putting. Third, after paying that amount of money we have to pay 5 euros to go to the bathroom. I don't mind personally. However, I went to remove my stockings and was reprimanded in a very rude way because I have to pay. Upon trying to give an honest feedback to a manager and tried to talk to possibly the owner. My feedback wasn't taken seriously and thus I'm here writing this review. I will not be back and would rather take my money elsewhere. If you can't be attentive to each one of your guests then probably you shouldn't be operating a restaurant.
