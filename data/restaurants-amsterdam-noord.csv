Nestled near our Airbnb, Bunk is a restaurant that not only delivers on quality but surpasses it in every imaginable way.\n\nThe menu at Bunk is a testament to creativity and finesse. Every dish we tried was a masterpiece, both in taste and presentation. The freshness and flavor of the ingredients were evident in every bite, each component thoughtfully selected and expertly combined. It's clear that Bunk takes immense pride in sourcing the best ingredients, transforming them into artful creations that delight the senses.\n\nOn our first night, we were so impressed that we decided to return the following evening to explore more of the menu. Amazingly, each dish we tried the second night was just as spectacular as the first, if not more so. The consistency in quality and the continuous surprise of new flavors left us in awe. It's rare to find a restaurant that excels across the board, but Bunk manages to do just that.\n\nThe drinks were another highlight of our experience. Each cocktail was crafted with the same attention to detail as the food, perfectly complementing the dishes and enhancing the overall dining experience.\n\nIn our opinion, Bunk is hands down the best restaurant in Amsterdam. It's a hidden treasure that deserves to be celebrated. If you find yourself in this beautiful city, do yourself a favor and visit Bunk. Trust us, it's an experience you won't want to miss."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-12T18:25:11"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Jennifer,\nWow, your review just made our day!

I asked him back because I know he wants to go out for dinner and he specifically said he wants to eat at Cannibale Royale. So I looked for a spot online but they only had 8pm and it was too late. So we took a nap, and at 4pm, I looked at the website again, saw that there was a spot for 6pm and immediately made the reservation.\n\nWas very happy that it was just 15mins from my place so we might end up being regulars because;\n-The staff were very welcoming, no strict assigned table and maybe because it wasn't that busy yet that we were able to choose our table. The corner table at the balcony showed how cool the interior was, cozy, rustic and very well thought.\n-The cocktail list (for me)had the top chosen favorites which made it easy to choose.\n-Food choices are easy and everything was just delicious! And the porkbelly & pickles, yummm! The roasted chicken made me the happiest that night. So simple but yet...really special.

Van 1941 tot 2011 nuttigden 1200 werknemers van Shell iedere dag hier hun lunch. Precies 70 jaar later kreeg het karakteristieke pand, ontworpen door architect Staal, een culturele bestemming. Samen met medebewoners Paradiso noord, Stichting Tolhuistuin, Solid Ground Movement en Tip Noord is hier invulling aan gegeven.

Het menu van THT bestaat uit kleine gerechten uit alle windstreken die uitnodigen om te delen. Je kan op deze manier een lange culinaire ontdekkingsreis maken. Maar voor diegene die op doorreis zijn, naar een voorstelling of concert, is er ook volop keuze.

a cozy restaurant, we enjoyed it very much. Service was amazing - so kind and helpful. Double cheeseburger was a very nice smashburger. I loved how they cooked Sukade. You don't even need a knife to eat it, the meat is almost melting, so tasty.\nThe only thing to improve would be to serve the Sukade (stewed flat iron steak with mashed potato) hot, instead of just warm. Because within 5 minutes after it's served, the dish was almost cold.

We had no explanation for the waiting. Service was extremely slow, never waited for the dishes like this in my life. We got offered for a bread, and the next round of bread never came. Waiters were passing next to our table, seeing that something is missing, and not reacting at all.\nBut, I have to say, food was excellent, very well balanced flavors.

ChIJCVvYDE0IxkcRyuDi2b9q9bY,Royalvis & Traiteur,"Royalvis & Traiteur staat bekend om de heerlijkste visschotels die je helemaal naar eigen wens kan samenstellen. Mega vers, zo uit de vitrine.

Het werkt leuk en eenvoudig: Je kiest uit de rijk gevulde counter de soorten die je wilt eten. Dit wordt gewogen en zo wordt de prijs van je visschotel bepaald. Vervolgens zoek je de bijgerechten uit die je erbij wilt eten. Als bijgerechten is er o.a. keuze uit diverse salades, rijst, paella, couscous, brood of knapperige frietjes. Je vis wordt a la minute gebakken of gegrild en geserveerd aan tafel met de bijgerechten. Nieuwsgierig geworden? Neem hier vast een kijkje op de menukaart.

Broodjes, portie kibbeling of een lekkerbekje? Dat kan natuurlijk ook.

Parking was not an issue for us as we were here at the weekend but during the week I am sure parking off site would present its own problems. Arrival smooth and efficient. On arrival the room was hot but the air-con unit was extremally effective. When we had problems with TV reception in the room, this was quickly resolved. Breakfast was  sumptuous and more than adequate, eggs anyway, along with pastries cereals yoghurts, cheeses and meats, if a little expensive at 14EU per person. The terrace in the evening was great to watch the sun set. The decor was excellent and in keeping with the vessels history. On the down side, our cabin (5) was next to the steps from the upper deck, so every time someone passed we could hear it clearly in our room, but worst of all, there was intermittent noise from a pump which came on randomly through the early night and evening right next to my bed head which disturbed my sleep on both nights. As for housekeeping, only the two towels we requested were changed. Beds remained unmade, complimentary toiletries were not refreshed, but the bin had been emptied."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-06-27T23:59:59"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeDRxV1Z3EAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Karl McKeown"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116525986754441221693?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""When we arrived there was a warm friendly welcome, as soon as you walk into the boat you are transported back in time. The boat is magnificent and kept in beautiful condition. Everything was clean and well cared for. Many thanks to Richard who is such a great host and knows the history of this beautiful vessel and was kind enough to answer all my questions. The breakfast was great and had the option of freshly cooked eggs and bacon which were cooked perfectly. The location was an easy free ferry ride to and from central station. The view from any window of the boat was stunning and we will definitely return to this wonderful place! Thank you for an unforgettable stay here. I think it's worth keeping in mind you're staying on a paddle boat from 1911!

I can barely wait for my weekly Monday morning visits to this spot. The sandwiches are excellent - the bread is fresh, and all the sandwiches are freshly made, and served with love at this family-run joint.

At the best, we had to walk 20 minutes to reach the hotel. The room was very uncomfortable. We were in 3, and i had to sleep on a bunk bed on the top floor over the first bed. I asked the hotel to change our room because i have the acrophobia and I can't sleep on the high points but they didn't care about it. They even asked me for more euros to change the room. The room was very small and uncomfortable. The cleanness of the room was very poor. After many times of asking to clean our room they left our room dirty and without replacing new towels. The room refrigerator was empty and if we were thirsty even to drink a bottle of water there was not the possibility. And the interesting point was that when we asked them to bring something to drink they told us that they don't have the room services and anything you want you have to go to the lobby.

We took a table near the bar and were surprised to see beautiful big parrot. That pure animal just an alive decoration here. She is not allowed to move from her stick. When she tried to walk out from her small place, waiter wrapped her in a towel, put back on stick and then start to spray with a water on parrot from all sides, like a punishment. The bird was screaming deafeningly. I really think it's not a best place for animal.\nAbout the food, we took a beef broth, which was tasty but looked very poor - only liquid and few mushrooms. We also took couple of beers and a snack plate for 21 euro and it was really bad looking, with rough crushed sausage, cheapest cheese and overfried snacks.

He suggested 2-4 dishes a person and in the end we had 6 dishes and 2 rice for the 3 of us and that was enough."",""published_at"":""2 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2022-06-27T19:17:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM_F9wy-qmxBAlHwQ6mF-b9x4Kt9Z5Qt66ZQBTd=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOVRzLd7MJG2YE2B3UZHHkdx85zuFeBMSxN8fqc=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOAu_NOvNZlE1IyUBZkKjSmetyeLNyZ-I1TFVwG=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOJGdNd8xKtUmStgCni43AsN_8p9owotnQtN9lQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNBVGmissRen06k28A8ditlThho77CfjiJWCL57=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4amVHalh3EAE"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Sahil Singh"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115304835526176124274?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Before I get started: I have eaten at over 20 fine dining restaurants and was very very excited to go to Papa Thang, because I love Thai Food when its thought differently than pad thai. Soooo.. first of all, the food itself is decent. The ingredients taste fresh and the preparation is somewhat special. The roasted cabbage for example was outstanding BUT most dishes were not mindblowing. The notion that its streetfood merged with fine dining might be reflected in the menu, i.e. the selection of dishes, but everything else is straight up ridiculous. The portions are hilariously tiny for what you pay. Expect tapas, not meals. We paid 180EU for 4 people and tbh Papa Thang turned out to be the kind of experience that people who never had a good fine dining experience make fun of. Besides, the service is slow. We had a table at 6:45, left at 9 and took the desserts home with us because it took them 45 mins to bring us the desserts. The desserts were a joke too, I have had much better desserts and I am willing to pay a lot but the portions were for little kids. Also, the drinks were mediocre at best.\n\nOverall, Service and Atmosphere were not it and we won't go back again. I wouldnt recommend."",""published_at"":""9 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-06-13T07:18:34"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Sahil.

advise others to avoid this place. From the moment I walked in, everything went wrong due to the staff's unprofessional and impolite behavior.\n\nFirstly, I had my e-bike battery with me and asked for help to store it somewhere safe. The staff member was dismissive and unhelpful, stating that I couldn't leave it in a locker or anywhere secure. I ended up leaving it in an unsafe spot, which was not ideal at all.\n\nSecondly, when the game instructions started, the same staff member began explaining everything in Dutch, despite us clearly being non-Dutch speakers. I politely asked if he could explain the rules in English, and instead of accommodating us professionally, he mocked me and begrudgingly switched to English in a rude manner. To make matters worse, during the game, the hints were sent only in Dutch as well, leaving us struggling unnecessarily.\n\nLastly, after the game, I grabbed my own water bottle for a drink. The same staff member approached me aggressively, telling me I wasn't allowed to drink my own water because they \""sell water here\"" and \""need to make money.\"" I explained that it was just my water and that we had already purchased beers, wines, and soft drinks. The behavior was completely out of line.\n\nThis place is not only poorly managed but also completely lacking in professionalism, respect, and basic customer service. You come to an escape room to have fun, but the staff's rude and unwelcoming attitude drains all the enjoyment out of the experience. I absolutely do not recommend this escape room to anyone.

Again, the staff were fantastic and added to the overall experience, helping with hints to guide us in the right direction and escaping with 1 minute to spare!"",""published_at"":""3 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2021-07-29T12:26:41"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNzl5QWp3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Mamta Deepan"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117554780924424968315?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""We had super family one.

I had the spicy sausage pizza, which was flavorful with a perfect crust, while my partner enjoyed the scallop spaghetti. Unfortunately, the spaghetti arrived cold, but the staff handled it perfectly--without hesitation, they replaced it with a fresh bowl, free of charge, which was much appreciated. The service was friendly and attentive, which made the experience even better.\n\nAll in all, Bello Gios offers great food, a fun atmosphere, and top-notch service.

Conveniently located at the NDSM harbour this restaurant is spacious with a cozy vibe. High ceilings and tons of artsy decorations make the dining experience quite special.\nThe staff was friendly but definitely tried to oversell by telling us we should take 3-4 starters followed by a pizza. Now, without judging anyone's food intake, 3-4 starters is a lot and the pizzas are decent sized and quite heavy. So overselling like that leads to food waste and a dissatisfactory experience for customers. They were also not super attentive. At first they were quite quick with taking the order but then once the food was there we never saw them again, even though there were just a hand full of tables. We had to shout across the restaurant to get anyone's attention for the bill and then again to actually pay.\nNow, the food:\nThe focaccia was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and was served with olive oil and salt.\nThe pizza with pepper and Goat cheese was exceptional. Maybe a bit experimental but I loved it. The taste of the pepper balanced out the taste of the goat cheese perfectly.\nThe pizza fungi was also very good with strong flavor of Parmesan.\nWe paid roughly 20EU per pizza which is not cheap but okay for what we got. It's not the best Pizza in town but it is very unique in concept and recipient so 4/5 is fitting."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-12T13:03:00"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Alina,\n\nThank you for sharing your feedback.It really warms our hearts to hear that you were so enthusiastic about the quality of our food at Bello Gio's by the River.

It was creative but the main course steak was quite disappointing. It was boring, the salty sauce covered the original taste of the steak. The starters (octopus) stood out among the dishes tho, and the rest were just okay. With this price you do have other options with better food in the city, considering the location is also hard to reach.\n\nThe view was great, even on a rainy day, but it was too noisy so I wouldn't recommend it if you're sensitive to noise. I also have to mention that the layout was really bad. Everyone was sitting so close by. We were placed in between two desks and whenever the waiter had to come over to serve the table on the corner, he kept rubbing my jacket hung on my seat. It was quite interrupting and annoying.

When the owner came for help he was extremely angry and stressed\n- The staff were not friendly at all.\n- We wanted one coke, we bought two cokes.\n- Sauces were missing.\n- Moreover, instead of meat burger, we received a chicken burger and we had to eat it to avoid getting even more stressed.\n\nHow could such a simple burger be so bad!

It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very memorable and reminded me more of a place to 'just eat something' rather than a restaurant that provides anything memorable.\n\nThe service was fantastic though.\n\nI will be rating this restaurant with 3 stars.

I can assure you that we only use high quality italian products and our pizza is napolitan style, we have a large choice of wines in our winelist with high quality wines and different prices, you chose the house wine which is a nice wine for a low price since we like to have beverage and food for people with different budget possibilities, but if it wasn't your taste ofcourse we also have fantastic wines for a higher price.

The attention to detail in the decor carries over to the food. The family that created il Pecorino has many talents.

Not too satisfied to order dessert, though :)\nThe prices were a bit higher than I anticipated. However, you get what you pay for at this restaurant. It's definitely a step up from the quickie place I expected to find in this area of Amsterdam.\nIf you enjoy interior design and decor, you're definitely in for a treat.

Definitely a recommendation."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-05-21T08:53:09"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":3,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPn_ing2JTdgHZE_YDCoN1HDxQrpmsdQ1CYrVBF=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP5aanW2prttAv25Qlh1qE4Q2j2x_ItTL3vgf6c=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMxC5V8VfLle7RfQaDgcte9xRvzvDI5cLBroaFE=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPUzOyAWYy5cM-c-QsMGG0_uJNC1sEg1wxfMn-t=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOqYzQ42F46WrCmXvloyFkeCuTADlyKCPzpEUet=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNycHVXQnhRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Chris Chris"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101719990795721835267?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Nice restaurant.\nThe sea soup are really fresh and the beef seafood as well .\nAlso good mosphere here ."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-06T16:03:30"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPgkY-RA1TISaBK7p21vWpBl4FFxlD7eHjAkobY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP3MHr-s91hT8UvoXrbH-0znA3I5OoDmPsq696i=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMkAx6u5N6-qnK4CkldonzvqIcXAItxqp4F26K3=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipONV5v2300dACjjBGQKLKcoEOW8hJ49gm3P57KP=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNR7SHxgq-T8Kz6BoGpfM_8a_6OAhjEVCIQEUiR=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNzjRrcV9w0aEb1_yXMPNIchZPis556yX2RjYl8=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN95XD3eyTXBoTyiLyzwgzRgCwq7AvEmfYD0nGh=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiOVBDTTBBRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""kholoud abouzid"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105221915866222870208?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""A unique experience, wonderful food, the restaurant manager is a respectable man who treated us kindly and gave us his best.

The food is creative and unbelievably flavorful. We had some of the best oysters ever here, better than at some michelin star restaurants. Their take on ceviche was mindblowing. The fried cauliflower is pickled first and you could taste it, so good. All in all, amazing and super comforting flavors. I've never had creative dining experiences that made me feel so cozy and comfortable. And tbh, cs is basically fine-dining without the price tag. Its not cheap but you get an insane value for your money. I mean 50EU for 5 courses is just really fair for Amsterdam. thats what makes cs great. It's unpretentious, and it's super good.

We ordered Nasi Rames and Nasi Goreng. Both of them were not bad, but it was just a little bit different than the taste of  Nasi Rames and Nasi Goreng that we are familiar with.\n\nAs an Indonesian, I personally think the Nasi Rames   is missing the balance between the salty and sweetness that mix well with herb and spices. We tasted the saltiness, but missing the sweetness. The nasi goreng also tasted more like rice with curry flavour than a real nasi goreng. The food presentation tho was very good.\n\nWhat we really like about this place is the atmosphere. We enjoyed reading travel books about Maluku there. The beverage: Tamarind Lemonade that we ordered was also very good."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-06-19T10:35:24"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMn4va5Uvil_uj3-ExPQeJaHi5d3OIjJ3o3VEwY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMW63hm-HP-f5SvDFDB__op_J3JZmttbKluuxtb=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNsE8EuRqv_L4CUMgxRicmua1njQUQ4x1k-gdNI=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPX1B6V05REAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Camille Eliseo"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103659795361622327308?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Spent a pleasant dinner away from the tourist spot, gado gado is easily a good indonesian plate with the subtle taste of peanut sauce and a kick of a spicy tofu.
