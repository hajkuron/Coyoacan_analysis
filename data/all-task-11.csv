De houten vloeren worden afgewisseld met Portugese tegels en het vele groen en de rode bomen zorgen voor een heerlijk parkgevoel.

De mooie ruimtes aan de achterzijde bieden plek voor in totaal 180 personen en zijn uitermate geschikt voor een bedrijfsuitje, personeelsuitje of verjaardagsdiner.

However, it's worth noting that such choices might seem a bit limited for a restaurant of this caliber.\nOn the beverage side, the wine selection was excellent, with some notable Italian options that added a touch of sophistication to the meal.\nThe service was top with a young and attentive staff ensuring that every aspect of the dining experience was taken care of.\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend Humphrey Restaurant for its unique ambiance, tasty food, excellent wine selection and attentive service.

Amazing atmosphere as well, cozy but very elegant at the same time.\n\nSpecial thanks to the owner Susie, super lovely lady and much appreciation on what she created with her restaurant ,  to our waiter Gustav who is been really helpful and kind, and of course to the kitchen staff.\n\nHighly recommended place!"",""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-02-14T00:02:34"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNmUIgCagolT6l_w1SIupH9mvF5_G7k4Zd1W58w=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOofRUEL4b7OId_d1ETqtklKB94UJ0-FDv6PptR=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMpyzdraPbgrICNq7eziH9QwJawxomG9U3OZCsZ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNQeioZh6D1zcv1lHvcQlXOQKQf3sCilmdf9qbl=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPPg3V6HRexEVk_85Uo7L1JN3PK6vDNBy8PKjS7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNdEH59tpCGowNkq_KTQrTbywFpJCs39Jf2fT9x=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM8hf6VIJxML6LeBy7ZHh5KcmnGse2jkonb7I2A=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2bVlQTER3EAE"",""rating"":1,""name"":""Ira Krasovskaya"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105951634524460396759?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""I had high hopes for this restaurant because everything looked amazing--the presentation of the dishes was beautiful, and the service was attentive and friendly. However, the actual taste of the food was shockingly bad.\n\nThe flavors were completely off, with ingredients that didn't complement each other at all. The sauce, in particular, was absolutely revolting--it genuinely felt like someone had puked into the dish rather than enhanced it. It was so unappetizing that we couldn't finish a single dish we ordered.\n\nI understand that some people in the Netherlands might be used to praising unconventional flavor combinations, but this was beyond that--it was just inedible. Sadly, it was a truly disappointing and bad experience.\n\nWouldn't recommend it at all unless they completely rethink their approach to flavor"",""published_at"":""3 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-21T22:22:49"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN7iMCPmbroVWRw6h_Wzd62nCj5jyXniQpjmAoY=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWdGNhNUxBEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Natalia MG"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112066680138509044753?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""It was amazing.

Around 2-3pm was not crowded but few people drink beers. My wife ordered Caesar salad which she said was not very good. For me I took Shish chicken which was okay but I didn't like the fried rice with curry and chicken was little bit dry. Also we took humus which was good. Service was okay and good interior. Overall not really good place to have lunch especially with family but might be good for having a few beers with friends and some appetizers."",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-25T15:32:29"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPXqmFlVf9FtF0_mjl3wR90AK0q-cBMxwmJy6pW=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNy4N80m3xeKbvdwO458HRmchzjthFnN8B4NrTS=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPO3mxc4UMtj-h7oKeMZZjmpkRXZHzGffsYypTY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPzdEoCNOZnp8lLVxW2IPk0fKCI5EOa6KpXlpdE=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOc--S-fOtBd_tKnIrL7SPJXS9u3q_tsanSVmTo=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNMGtMNpNDrd8xP6ZUbcNxY6Unqh4vjCk22BClZ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP32QaBbHD5s-8JWLlITSOmFFDRIAnpxCm2AC8X=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOC3YzK8q6R8Ak8BvDVoEEaS__foCF6BcziBXzs=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP2KitGbQ4xNciIZVaz2sdytkhxjIbM04xBTsHq=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOpEZIIaixyXGP_FnxgghDYDwN3I3rjGHPTo4tT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNklfAM6ZUnsmy8XkG00hs3NDPf2HtvD4jPH_lT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNZDbsJZjS-xEEOm0RAolnc2oEZU4HFonqbRiJH=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxbFlEbW5nRRAB"",""rating"":4,""name"":""LCD"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107303312165145051057?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Went here on our last day in Amsterdam.

The Vleminck fries were good, but took way longer than they should coming from the shop across the street. Only the rotisserie chicken was good, but you can easily get the same at a market.

Don't miss out on their incredible beef stew- it's truly a highlight!"",""published_at"":""2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-26T12:46:38"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOsKVcSDdE3CfG6oOdcsgG3CIlLIbSVZMshAp33=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOhzawW39r9nuipNlcGBwImezzuHbp1pWxYxMfa=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMxcFBMaz5IEN8rGLPxHDy3o4lUts0QpnmCHUOO=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOgjat7chO_DHOL-ApEiNogkz3QAEjKzgWpA1sy=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMcfRbEPArMy7luvilDR1SD5mRPjvDKuvF3fY0y=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN9565gZgwDt0JaVM0R7qo31lR-1UDzIjb5yeBE=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNm5179QsZQVdbYnbNR2b3Cipu1xWtbqzfI74v_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNiRlqoPXShrCN7liQKw1dVdjSSXKfU2cluyqbK=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPFj-d5pY9B-AZQR3hugNDv7YmItqixmtQk-JNt=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN2RuPx87NjmHS3viBZSp-VCgunSU0lLtbCxdn7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPSeGrhtN0jLmpPfq_pXZeVFhsoN5zhDLXy8qHY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP1GBiCfe-jp1efe3nBXfnh60UPdO1oVmWalzAT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOOf681_rJQMKrbQDt19KOfeC20UDirCd4on8pe=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMqo7EqaprWMNCehRrkclTgPfsH5Koa2S-Mj1p8=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNVBMIzLfneS4-tvFomSycBXThAbdVTjuiBUoGc=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQZ3JfQm5BRRAB"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Katarina Perovic"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115445756085008571700?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""This place has a very unique and beautiful story!

After paying EU160 per person and reserving for six, we expected a memorable dining experience--but it was far from that.\n\nWe arrived at 9 PM, but the evening quickly went downhill. We waited almost an hour just to receive menus, as the waitress forgot to provide them. After another 30 minutes, our food finally arrived, but the quality was shockingly poor.\n*\tThe mussels with caviar were incomplete, with some missing the caviar entirely.\n*\tThe carpaccio was unappetizing and barely resembled a proper dish. It was also frozen.\n*\tThe tagliatelle with lobster was another disappointment--the lobster was empty, leaving only pasta in tomato sauce.\n*\tFor the mains, the beef, requested well-done, was served raw, and the salmon was excessively oily and tasteless. My wife even felt unwell after trying it.\n*\tBy the time dessert arrived at 11:45 PM, our appetite and patience were gone.\n\nThe waitress, clearly sympathetic, acknowledged our concerns and called the manager. He apologized and assured us of a full refund. However, we later received a call offering only half the amount as vouchers for the same restaurant--a poor resolution, especially as we live in Germany and are unlikely to return. When we spoke to the owner, she became defensive and unfriendly when we mentioned sharing this review.\n\nTo make matters worse, other guests around us voiced similar complaints about the service and food quality. It was clear that this wasn't an isolated incident.\n\nThis experience was unacceptable. Instead of celebrating New Year's Eve in a joyful and memorable way, we ended up hungry and disheartened on the streets of Amsterdam. We hope the restaurant takes this feedback seriously to prevent others from enduring such an unfortunate experience."",""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-03T17:13:14"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Mehmet, \nhereby my answer: \n-The mussels with caviar were incomplete, with some missing the caviar entirely. These were oysters and you never mentioned that 1 of those was missing caviar, we would offer 3 instead, like we did with soft drinks, since you were not drinking any alcohol ( bubble glas was included)\n- Carpaccio you ate it all and not shared anything about this issue\n- Linguine lobster you ate it all, and the portion was quite big, we put half lobster for every portion\n- Main: the 3 filets we offer an option but you did not want it, question: how many wives felt sick?, because this just happened while writing the review and never mentioned, not even in your first message...quite strange I can say!\nI think it is normal to became defensive if you or 1 of your group threaten you  and offend you!

Housed in a classic Amsterdam building, the restaurant exudes a cozy and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe ambiance was delightful, and the staff were warm and welcoming. Seating is limited on the ground floor, and we climbed a steep, winding staircase to our reserved table on the second floor. While the restaurant was bustling, the service, though friendly, was notably slow.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Angus tenderloin, requesting it medium rare. Unfortunately, it arrived dry and closer to medium well. What I found particularly disappointing was that the steak did not come with a sauce. It had to be ordered separately--unlike my experiences in French restaurants. Instead, I had to pay extra for it, which felt odd. Dessert was a mixed experience--it was far too large, and the chocolate cake crumble was overpowering. Neither of us were able to finish it. A smaller, more balanced portion would have been preferable.\n\nDespite these hiccups, we enjoyed a wonderful evening in good company. Bistro Bleu is worth a visit for its ambiance, though a few improvements could make the dining experience even better."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-19T09:58:09"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey there, Eliane Muskus!

The food was amazing and the place was really lively, though we did start off a bit annoyed. But that didn't really spoil the whole fun evening.\n\nOn a busy Saturday night, I felt excited but also a bit mixed up. The bistro was full of energy, but we had a small problem at the start. We were sitting upstairs, kind of alone, and it took slightly more than 20 minutes just to get our drinks. This little mix-up was a bit of a letdown at first. And, trying to get a server's attention to order our food, even though they were close by, was a bit annoying.\nIt looked like people sitting downstairs got their orders faster.\n\nAs the night went on, any small issues we had at first were quickly forgotten because the food was just so good.\n\nStarters\nThe scallops were amazing - cooked just right and came with a really tasty pillow of peas that was a nice surprise.\nThe smoked salmon on toast was simple but really well done, with great quality ingredients that all worked well together.\n\nMain Courses\nThe French Fish Stew really stood out. It was a big, tasty mix of seafood, veggies, and a creamy sauce, and there was so much of it I couldn't even finish it all.\nMy partner had a Black Angus tenderloin that was just perfect - it looked great and tasted even better, especially with the peppery sauce that made it even more special.\n\nDessert\nThe Tarte Tatin with caramel ice cream was the perfect end to a great meal. It was just the right size for sharing.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBistro Bleu really shows off how good food and drinks can be, all in a lively and pretty place.\n\nThe slow service at the start was a small hiccup, probably because they needed more staff. And if you want your food faster, sitting downstairs might be a good idea. But honestly, the quality of the food stands out on its own, regardless of the wait.\n\nBistro Bleu is definitely a place you should try, with each dish feeling like it was made with a lot of attention "",""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-02-25T10:10:35"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNTnRRvgcR2pHBldthFKdxLv-i99sxWcdYGPvjP=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNhDe0bGirtLBzP9liT4uccvar12u1GP1aqNXxf=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOhrWL4QeTwAsyXcYp85HniIW0MsElczgcUEjh6=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNdx1M_JmlnUU9Zr2b-eYN7p5J6HjTy3-Z6BfZ_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNriVxbFhb_ut5bpZfPTnyYfVO36djfQWMduGOC=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmaGIzbWdRRRAB"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Rich Gollinge"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102121155104326895798?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""We walked in and smelled sewage.

We ordered smoked salmon on toast, \""French\"" onion soup, steak tartare and the signature Bleu salad with grilled chicken. Oh boy, where to begin? The soup.. bland, flat, devoid of any flavor. The stock seemed to be chicken, maybe they dunked a chicken in hot tap water and boiled onions in it to call it soup. Smoked salmon on sourdough toast was also lacking in flavor, no presentation, but at least my wife got some protein. The salad was decent, fresh mesclun greens with half a hard boiled egg, house made vinaigrette.. But the chicken- was not only NOT grilled, it tasted like 2 day old baked baked chicken thigh uncovered in the fridge, then reheated for the salad. Steak tartare- well at least it was ground beef. However, it did not have the traditional encoutrements, and was served with white bread toast that was grilled. We spent nearly 100 Euros on this and to be honest, it was the worst meal we ate in Amsterdam. A 100 Euro meal should taste like one.

The appetizer came before the glasses of wine and when we were barely done with the appetizer, the main dish was coming and it was extremely rushed almost like they needed space for other guests.\n\nThe ravioli limone were fantastic but the price for 8 ravioli for 27EU was a little bit too much.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was carbonara of my boyfriend. It came completely cold, looks like it was waiting for my ravioli too long to be served together. When we complained to the young waiter, he asked the kitchen and we got a new portion. Well, not better one. The pasta was overcooked, the sauce was like water and the taste was like powder cheese, very artificial taste. We would have been waiting for longer if we know it's getting better unfortunately this was a big fail.\n\nAlthough the staff is smiling, is clearly inexperienced-one lady does not make you feel welcome at all, the other tries her best and the gentleman was the best. Unfortunately we left with extremely mixed feelings and never will be back. Missed chance, I am sorry.

However, once we sat down and ordered it took just over an hour for all of our meals to arrive. Parties who came in after us of 2-5 people received their main meals far in advance of us. The waitress who served us seemed impatient with us after our mains were served and she must've been at the end of her shift since after a few leading queries about whether we were finished or not, she never returned and we had to hunt down an alternative waitress to pay the bill since no one was around except by the bar. Mind the restaurant was open for another two hours at the time we actually left. Perhaps it's a culture difference...\n\nThe food on the other hand was delicious. We had the tenderloin, fish, and a fried Thai-esque dish. Dessert was also delicious despite the passive rush for us to leave. The gentleman who delivered the panna cotta was very kind and enthusiastic about the desserts that were being delivered.\n\nAll in all, good food with mediocre service. Those who deliver the food are kind, though from what I saw around us, if you are POC or don't speak Dutch, know you'll get a couple side eyes from the staff. Despite that, almost everyone spoke Dutch and English and had menus in both."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-25T20:59:04"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Grace,\n\nThank you for your feedback.

I highly recommend adding coriander you will thank me later. A word of caution: the very spicy option is indeed very spicy, so eat at your own risk!\n\nAlso the sitting option is limited few seats inside and 2 tables outside which are always full, so it's better for takeaway.

I hope they get vacuumed.\nThe service was subpar,  the staff had forgotten about us and we couldn't get our order in for over 20 mins. Then the waiter had forgotten to out our order in and it took and additional 30 min.\nThe food itself was lovely, well at least what I had ordered.  I really enjoyed the grandma's vegetable salad and a refreshingly salty plate of marinated smelts.  I loved the mussels in a creamy broth. However,  the Nicoise salad was an absolute joke. Apparently,  the chef had never looked up a recipe before. It was missing several key ingredients.  It's was a mushy mess with canned tuna a big blob of mayonnaise. Why would you ever do that to a salad???\nLastly, it took forever to get a check.\nSo, my recommendation,  check this place out for sure, but stuck to the restaurant specialties, don't venture out and try what you think are safe options,  you'll be disappointed."",""published_at"":""4 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-14T08:28:51"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipObBLNif_O_gmXRFyTpd_erAsTujnZdNbjiff8Z=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMcT4Gxd7g1dcimugM7tF9jK0yeCRKndn3LJymh=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO7GKTyUu-NpTAO_EsbywmRxDndz7icLPIKTB8t=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMMWKPIZaI76BKqs_POz8YZ-LDqwo8SDiHTO_Vx=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2cnB6U0JnEAE"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Eric Hew"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114554995887706158124?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Didn't give me a wow experience to warrant a 5 star.

I called with my Apple Watch, and the lady first made sure that I was the phone's owner by asking me to describe the lock screen and other features. I said that I was alone with kids who were asleep. Would a driver be able to drop it off? She said no and explained that she didn't want to give my phone to a random driver. She offered to drop it off after her shift as I live nearby. She actually came much earlier, bringing me the phone personally. What a fantastic woman! Staff of the year.

Pizza had lots of flavour, with fresh creamy mozzarella, would say is frozen pizza bases just don't hit the same as fresh and for that it's a mark down.\n\nOverall the food was good solid and good value just a strange slow service.\n\nFinal score here 7/10 - the food certainly saved it."",""published_at"":""4 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-12T20:43:55"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for your detailed feedback, Jake.

My wife, daughter and l live in Amsterdam and my older kids were visiting from Dubai. We reserved the table but the booking system only allowed us to book for 4 people so my wife and daughter went ahead to explain and hope that they could sit us comfortably. They did manage to put us in a 6 seater table but then the manager decided to state that the table had to be available for 8:15 pm. I said quite emphatically that provided they do their normal good service then we should have no issues. Unfortunately things went south wrong and quickly. I asked for tap water and they offered only bottled water. After setting Thad walked for an hour and only wanted to quench my thirst quickly with some tap water and after some convincing I did finally get my tap water. My children wanted salmon but they only had one salmon. My wife and I really wanted their steak because usually it is so good. But today our medium cooked steak came out well done and dried and like it had been sitting on the side. We did actually have to chase our dinner and with the pressure they had put us under to get off our table we chased our dinner to which it came out quickly once someone asked the chefs for our meals. The steak was quite awful but once the manager was told he 22:37\nno\nku\nYour reviews\narranged for more steak to be cooked.\nHonestly with the chips, bread, mushroom sides we were losing our appetite for the steak but it arrived 20 minutes after complaining. This is after already having to wait 40 minutes for our mains to be served that we also had to chase. Our next steak came out medium rare or perhaps even rare.\nWe just had to abandon because it was our last night and we were running out of time.\nWe have. It lost faith in this restaurant but we might not come back in a Saturday night. We will come again and hope for the same experience we have had several times before. We took the steak away in a \""doggy bag\"" and hope we can cook it again to our liking. We pain full price but of course no tip."",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-08-10T20:39:58"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPvRp7RYziJz8RbP_3PJwuFQYIOOYVhXxpnlzs=s1024""]}]",[],restaurants

I asked the male chef his recommendation for the sauce and he was so happy I did that. Trust your chef, they will guide you to a food coma. Thanks from an Aussie tourist.

There was only 1 person working the dining room, and probably only 1 person working the kitchen because service was SO SLOW. We ordered muscles and beef carpaccio for the table. The muscles were good, the beef carpaccio was paper thin and would stick to the plate, so it just shreds. There wasn't a whole lot of sauce for this so it lacked in flavor. For mains I got the truffle pasta, which I had hoped would be toss tableside, but unfortunately was done across the room. This dish was decadent but overall not very impressive.

Once I finished the waiter asked me if it was good, I said gently to be honest not really. They said it would be spaghetti, it wasn't but on top of it I ordered it for the truffle, and there was barely even the flavor. But that all good.

situated in a charming classic building with a canal-side terrace. The ambiance of the restaurant was very pleasant.\n\nThe food was beyond delicious, and the service was warm and welcoming. We began with a generous Mezze spread accompanied by fresh Turkish bread, followed by flavorful main dishes and indulgent Baklava with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert.\n\nEvery dish we tried was exceptional, showcasing authentic flavors. Levant stands out as more than just your typical Turkish kebab restaurant, offering a truly memorable dining experience. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a taste of authentic Turkish cuisine."",""published_at"":""7 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-06-04T11:06:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPIkMme0oUu4bOhaD-1_ZTog7lCXdJs17qHr7Td=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO4SUfH05CMElOxjOZYPnG9Jha52R_I6V6AwbhA=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMIYrKq3C1-WQ_ucHsieBjGa_OxtxFJlC8c7v3J=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMtu8G6S50UA455g60utB0hw6fRgKjTVArEPvS-=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMnJZAAVANoiEjjl8P3ipGdOyLLXkmiVrrVjNw9=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPkEZJgQwjsqV1EpoAU2AtdWW5VFNkbtz-NVXxL=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOLJgf66S_5jEHzFEAiCoDSsW3IRVuIWMjHZwwe=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuNlBhdDJBRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Danny Smalle"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109865045873375006094?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""I passed here several times and I like Mediterranean food, so for once I didn't continue direction Leidseplein but entered.

For mains, we had the beef, cod, pea ravioli, and steak tartare. Each dish was beautifully presented, showcasing fresh ingredients and classic techniques. The simplicity of the food allows the quality to really shine.\n\nThe venue itself is truly something special. Housed in an old water pumping factory, the restaurant's high ceilings and preserved factory equipment give it a striking industrial-chic vibe.

Creamy mushroom soup elicited nostalgic emotions.  The delicious and cooked to perfection schnitzel with a balck pepper sauce  was a celebration of quality meat. The simple sides of cooked leeks and fried ( real, not French fries) potatoes made it so much homier. For dessert , we went for the pudding of the day, which was a tapioca pudding ( not the nursing home kind, but the delicious and thick kind) with whipped cream and a liqueur-used thinl layer of sauce with have a gourmand bitterness,  toning down the sweetness.

Understated decor -- they could try a little harder to honest. It doesn't have a lot of personality. But it's OK. I felt comfortable here, and that's important. The staff were not massively forthcoming or enthusiastic though, which did miff me a little.\n\nI ordered a glass of red wine and a beef steak with chorizo and mustard sauce. It came with a salad and a baked potato and on the whole, it was good. The steak was excellent and the mustard sauce was even better -- it took my breath away. Literally. It was hot as a mother. The place as a whole though, was kind of bland, the waiter was not remotely engaged and the salad had one olive. I mean, come on. One olive is much more of an insult than no olives. Oh, and there were little flies flitting about, for which I did not care.\n\nOn the whole, pretty good but with lots of room for improvement.

The staff repeatedly stared at us, to the point where it felt like they were sizing us up. Before our food arrived, one staff member stood right behind my chair with his hand on it, listening in on our private conversation, which was incredibly intrusive. To make matters worse, while we were eating, I was bizarrely told to switch to another seat for no apparent reason, further disrupting the experience.\n\nWhen it came to the food, the ribs were overly sweet and sickly, and the salad looked nothing like the menu photos. While it did fill me up for the evening, the quality left much to be desired.\n\nThe final interaction was the most off-putting. When the bill arrived, the older waiter made a point of highlighting the tip section and seemed displeased when I chose not to add one. He sulked, walked away without thanking us, and didn't even say goodbye.\n\nThis restaurant has potential with its fair pricing and ambiance, but the staff's attitude and the food quality need serious improvement to make it a place worth recommending."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-19T15:32:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NWR2SHN3RRAB"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Abu Isaac"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115443352950219315272?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Food was lovely.

I come to Fulu every time to celebrate birthdays, festivals, and friends' graduations. I still remember the first time I came to Fulu for dinner was last winter. The academic pressure made me miss home, and my friend invited me to eat at Fulu. When I opened the door on the first floor, it was almost full of Chinese people, and the smell of Chinese food made me feel like I was back home. When I looked at the menu, I felt like I wanted to eat everythingAfter the dishes were served, everyone stopped talking and started to eat. I felt healed by the taste of home.\nWe ordered several dishes and I recommend the following ones:\n-Dry pot shrimp: The shrimp meat is full and chewy, delicious and spicy \n-Spicy chicken: Very layered, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, the taste of pepper makes me want to eat it unstoppably\n-Fish-fragrant eggplant: Although I occasionally make it myself, I still ordered it. It is completely different from making it with flavor packets. It is unexpectedly delicious and really amazing to eat with rice\n-Twice-cooked pork: The surface is shiny and slightly burnt. The meat is soft and chewy when eaten. It is fat but not greasy, lean but not dry. It is a must-order with friends every time\n-Dry-fried green beans: After coming here, I found that green beans are difficult to fry and difficult to make it good taste. This green bean is perfect.\nBecause the restaurant is in the tourist area,  it's beside Dam square and it's at the exit of Rokin subway station, you can often see tourists coming to eat. It is really kind to see people from my motherland when I am away from homeThe waiters are also very thoughtful and attentive, and I am very happy every time I come. I think it's the best Chinese restaurant in Amsterdam. If you miss the food of your hometown, and if you want to taste authentic Chinese food, come here for a meal!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-05T19:53:43"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Carol J,\nWe're so pleased that you enjoyed the atmosphere!

For the two of us, we escaped for a weekend trip from Germany to Amsterdam. Did a little research and found this place. We both were very happy with the food and the authentic taste. Only little bummer - we ordered the bill and both needed a quick visit at the bathroom before leaving. While we still had a little sip of beer in our bottles the young waiter put already the menus on the table for the next customers. When I came back from the bathroom he took my bottle even before I could finish it. After an 8EU tip this was very rude. But guys in case this place is offering a take away - food is awesome.

Watergang is currently one of my favorite places in Amsterdam for no fuss, high quality food.\n\nThey offer a 5 course surprise menu which changes according to the season. Every dish is well-thought where each component is in harmony. There's no fancy chef tricks just for the sake of it. You can also ask for a wine pairing or pick something from their extensive wine menu, which includes a variety of options from different parts of the world. Since their menu changes, I can't comment on a particular dish, but from our recent visit, the most memorable plate was the sous vide pork belly with smoked eel. I never thought pork belly could be that light! Of course, there's also their pillow-soft brioche bread you just want to bury your head in.\n\nThe atmosphere is very charming with cozy lighting, soft music playing in the background. It's an ideal spot for a date night or a nice dinner with friends. We were especially happy with the service, the staff is attentive and kind, they're knowledgeable about the menu and wine. The service is also fast.\n\nHighly recommend Watergang, and we can't wait to go back."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-25T12:10:13"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNlYQcrvDauKcRsVjismP5h9uBubcS0F0NmZBGi=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOliEjKyZT59sJRrLmn2EEhSmOowmMCO9Hz0tDn=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNH5Ti3LMfY5uJelQa2n7wI0bDuvO7UnI9xAEUP=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOOs46gutDajiepkuEpiVWUUHDhYDDyQNASGc0f=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMP_0lG4ME49ItvvJ9DmGyFD_3owidPn1dkU6dd=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPLJAiX1Rfq77bZhIx79t5oHbBVAFowZVaxQdqt=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOwA7QuGcigxpVeyfjKojyrHkgIyrG2ax5ujwA3=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMzZTVG13RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Onur Ogucu"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113780673927589882570?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""A cozy restaurant in a classic Amsterdam building, offering a seasonal five-course set menu and a nice wine selection.

Started with cucumber gaspacho, fish and sorbet, mussels, meat for main (forgot to take a picture of last two courses) and dessert. They offer wine pairing, I'm quite picky about wine but loved what they offered, fresh wines, oaky wines, organic wine and light red at the end. All worked out perfect.\nService is great, atmosphere is nice, relatively quiet place.\nWe paid around 300 for 2 people dinner, 5 courses with wine pairing. Genuinely enjoy it a lot!\n\nRegarding what could have been better, 2 main points,\n\nMaybe a bit bigger portions or more bread at the beginning. Dinner took around 3.5 hours, we didn't notice time while speaking but at some point after 3 courses I was feeling hungry, at the end was fine though.\nSo, knowing how important for restaurants to stay profitable, either courses can come a bit faster at the beginning or adding more bread can be a good idea. By the way bread they brought at some point was fantastic.\nSpace between tables, it's a small place and some tables are on the corners or on the way, so we struggled to choose where to sit."",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-08-02T07:02:46"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMl87yUItIZouFIlHceqQA_Z8NGSpv1-vzMiyNX=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMXGJPsLMIMMG_wLaND4cypH76fy7qE8rEhEQgi=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNt41mogT5nsN6oeOFw_MH__0uSC3gcK0tQ7P8n=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPCS_-M86EsxfQ1RULCcj2SvwxONLVvA40gD1Ar=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOro-tmMshthKf0jAm--x7C0iWoRW2rSvXc_7OT=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMdS1PT0Z3EAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Jose Ceron"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112775056689027654605?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""We had the 5-course menu, with wine pairing and oysters, and everything was excellent.

They offered breakfast and lunch as well but I came for dinner. The foods were absolutely smashing, good onion stew, steak cooked perfectly to my liking, apple-tart with ice cream was a wonderful finish to a hearty meal. Portion just about right and kept me full until late into the next morning. Old-style cozy warm place, friendly staffs and speedy services. Nice location in the city centre and has good view of the street. The first day i did not meet the boss of the house (Antonio the cat) but the second day i came at dinner, Antonio was at the front of the house, greeting and welcoming the guest! Update: the foods, the service and Antonio the boss kept me coming for the 3rd time the next day. Met the cat again, ordered different dishes and they tasted exceptional as well. Really recommended!

It was cooked exactly as I had requested, and the blend of well chosen ingredients struck the perfect balance between robust flavour and delightful simplicity. The creamy cheese and the crisply toasted, slightly sweet bun elevated the whole experience.\n\nThe seasonal beer, a Belgian-style Ambre ale currently on offer, with its slightly dry flavour profile, was an excellent match for the meal. The selection changes seasonally, ensuring there's always something new to try out. Although initially disappointed by the unavailability of local Damrak gin, the Hendrick's gin and tonic served was flawless in mix and presentation, achieving an appealing balance without being overdone.\n\nThe window seat provided a vibrant view of Amsterdam life, a city that brings diverse people together. The bar's atmosphere, with its mix of 80s and 90s pop and rock and sports screenings, is perfect for a relaxed meal with a partner or friend. Additionally, the bar's policy on not accommodating large groups preserved the peace, and the staff's tactful management of such situations ensured everyone left in good spirits.\n\nGrizzly American Bar is a gem, ideal for those looking to enjoy superbly crafted food and drink in a friendly and inviting setting."",""published_at"":""8 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-05-10T18:57:13"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNsJJyAhZekTs-4Cyy5zKwUNfjv-MAP45o6kPB5=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNphMLjGqTKzCcOUtaXb-KyjJV1XT4dN-p5dpgI=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN9UOR3RE2BH8A2q9QOk_Hu92FJaj-PlJSt3CIT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMjiw5HvtGctnDvJ1mkcIMII_uNGzYI8XJ3rDz4=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPTDMGxSyEfnkJzGNCqkK0XgKYSw3n0m6cLCrrI=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMkXto4k0EIiuaJjsyZxbGIIig0i059V0zFmWrq=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOOE2A2s-KvSbgez3QiKG3RInWIvXuRFSynV0qJ=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQdUotTDZRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""claire moore"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106779399179576151002?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Nice friendly atmosphere!

The food was good. The service staff were helpful. I didn't experience any rude behaviors mentioned in some other reviews. On the contrary, all 3 people that took care of our table were nice and friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the noise. I don't know if it's because of the small space or just the people around us were too loud, but it was distracting and a little tiring too. The risotto with pear and walnuts was interesting. I don't think I will crave for it later, but it was worth trying anyway. The prices are a little high, but it was a good dinner.

The service started well considering that even after opening the service team was clearly a bit delayed and not really ready to open. We got a seat by the entrance window which was nice and the service started well. We got the fish of the day and spaghetti a la vongole. The fish was really good actually. The spaghetti was missing flavour amongst other things but it was an okay dish. The downside is that the food takes incredibly long to come out, especially considering that we were the first people at the restaurant. We then asked the waiter if she could check on our food and she said that it is coming shortly given that all the pasta is made fresh, which I understand but that is something that I would automatically be expecting if I were dining in an Italian restaurant. The waiter wasn't rude or mean but I was just surprised as much as she seemed after we wondered about our food. The restaurant is okay.

To culminate our trip in Europe, we went to fine dining restaurant and this is it! The restaurant features a great ambience overall in a two story building with an alfresco area. Surprisingly, a detailed menu is kept as a secret until you each dish is served on your table. What a suspense! And the food presentation is astonishingly beautiful, not to mention, the refined style of meaty flavor from baby lamb and some fish. The staff was kind enough to explain how the food was created and cooked in what ingredients. Everything was on point and the taste was divine.

The carbonara was flat out disgusting. Bitter and salty.

We had the wings and the hummus for appetizers and both were excellent!  Wings were tender, juicy and perfectly glazed.  Hummus was very tasty, I could have eaten another plate of it.\nFor dinner we had the grilled prawns that were tender and sweet.  Ribeye was tender and perfectly cooked.  Corn was OK but the fries were awesome!!!  Service was excellent and waiter was attentive.  I'm surprised this restaurant is not rated much higher on Google.

The restaurant offers a variety of well-cooked steaks, with the Lomito being a popular choice among patrons.\n\nThe steak quality is very good, and the meat is cooked to perfection. The location is convenient, being close to Dam Square, which makes it an easy choice for tourists exploring the area. The staff is friendly, adding to the positive dining experience.\n\nHowever, the restaurant's setting is quite simple, with basic chairs and tables. It's not a fancy place, so don't expect a luxurious ambiance. Steaks are served on their own, and you need to order sides separately. While some might prefer this, it can be a downside for those who expect a complete meal without additional charges. Additionally, the staff, while friendly, can be a bit slow, which might affect the overall dining experience.\n\nOverall, CAU Steak Restaurant is a great choice for those looking to enjoy good steak near Dam Square. Despite its simplicity and a few drawbacks, the quality of the food makes it worth a visit."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-06-30T20:04:34"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Ziv,\nThank you for your wonderful review!

The decor perfectly sets the stage for a delightful evening.\n\nWe opted for the chef's tasting menu for two, and it was nothing short of amazing. Each course was thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented, showcasing the best dishes that Ashoka has to offer. The portions were just right, allowing us to savor each flavor without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAmong the standout dishes, the butter chicken was a true highlight. Rich and creamy, it was bursting with flavor--definitely one of the best I've ever had. We also loved the masala, which was perfectly spiced and complemented the other dishes beautifully. Every bite was a celebration of Indian cuisine, and the variety in the tasting plate kept our taste buds excited.\n\nWhat truly enhanced our experience was the exceptional service. The staff were not only helpful but also genuinely friendly. They were attentive without being intrusive, making sure our dining experience was seamless and enjoyable.\n\nOverall, our evening at Ashoka was a wonderful culinary journey that we will be talking about for a long time. We can't wait to return and explore more of their delicious offerings. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience!"",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-21T13:05:20"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hello.

We had Chicken Choila and Chicken Momo. The Momo were a bit of a disappointment, as they were served cold. We were expecting them to be at least warm, considering how they're typically enjoyed fresh, but they missed the mark in that regard.\n\nHowever, the main course more than made up for it. The Kukhura Ko Masu (traditional Nepalese chicken curry) was absolutely on point. The flavour was rich, and well-seasoned. It was the highlight of the meal, and we really enjoyed it. It came with rice by default, and we added an extra garlic naan, which was delicious, warm, and perfectly complementing the curry.\n\nWhat really made the experience stand out was the service. The staff was exceptionally friendly, attentive, and accommodating, which made us feel very welcome throughout our meal. They were definitely a big part of the positive experience.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was also quite nice -- cozy, inviting, and with a relaxed atmosphere that made it perfect for a casual lunch."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-10T08:44:32"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP5aAbObprveemhzgTBJaaX52jUSAIVIJ2WjAbV=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPSPjN7kG-S--8LzrRKTMy7IU6lUH31vrXW5_wL=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNAl3-Cq2RCD9pEBNl4japwwETwZauSLm1Vi-u4=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOyx3R-h4LlGB_sauisilFF6ZrFFiUkkmH8oq0f=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNjPP1m4Qba2Vh0qmX40ioeCTmNXhCyQWTa37jg=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPKThkkJ2_ZBeg4gFxZng4UVWLhhKC7JCbuVuY0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPQe6ffBnjp3sRJF9pp5iut7MsfC5WlTFdguKms=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNKjXjjryI6tgOsCijAxgFTECW_VRjGoT-ZNuYs=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzODY2MXFRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""amy o'toole"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115376957273618023539?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""My favourite restaurant in Amsterdam!

We have a Robotic Bar-Tender that makes precisely measured cocktails and mocktails again and again without missing washing the glass or changing alcohol percentage - not even by-mistake. We thought that there is more value in using Robots for making a perfect drink instead of just serving on table. This took us a year long effort integrating state-of-the-Art 7 different engineering technics e.g. Robotic-Ai-IT-Electrical-Electronics-Mechanical-Civil and hosting on google-cloud.

I will definitely be back!"",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-29T12:52:06"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMzYAyAmjnTFIsg7IenPb7Mlg4L85uFiMMC86Gx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMA1KC_ZoFmy9uCSnls0AKzcE8XcouPHwlvE82C=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOVPNWlmerOPctrNZY63ZE1QFftYWW74Qq_3ich=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPh5f1ukmVrGWGSaa4Fxg9tL7H9bTOP5U0QdVK6=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYZzgtX0p3EAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""James Michael"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115524468226408313233?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Overall a superb French experience in Amsterdam.

When we arrived we were greeted in a friendly way and given a nice table. After about 10 minutes the sommelier, asked if we wanted to see the wine menu, but we were not given the food menu's. So we decided to just have a glass of wine, since we had no idea what we were going to be eating. I further found the way that the sommelier acted was a bit arrogant and patronising. I can maybe understand it if he would be working in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but not in a bistro.. The food was fine, bouillabaisse, tartare de boeuf and goose liver for starter were fine. We decided to have the special of the day, which was a beef Wellington for two. As it was for two, I expected it to be a small Wellington or similar, but I was surprised when they just served two slices of Wellington on a plate. Why did this have to be ordered for two people? It came with some salad and fries. The beef was nicely cooked, but the pastry was very soggy and for some reason they had wrapped the inside layer (which I assume was a crepe) with lettuce leaves, which was a first for me in a Wellington. So I was not blown away, and my son told me he preferred the Wellington I make at home.. My wife's bouillabaisse was fine. She did throw up all night, but we are not sure what caused that, and as I had the same thing as a starter and I had no issues, I don't think it was the bouillabaisse. But overall, we left with mixed feelings, and I am not in a hurry to return."",""published_at"":""2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-28T18:09:21"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're truly sorry to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations. As a restaurant known for our hospitality, it's very disappointing to hear that the service, did not reflect the warm and welcoming atmosphere we strive to create. We will certainly address your comments with the team to ensure that all guests feel valued and well looked after, as this is a key part of who we are.\n\nRegarding the Beef Wellington, we apologize for any confusion. Our Beef Wellington for two is a substantial dish, and it's often more than one person can comfortably enjoy when paired with starters and dessert. We always recommend sharing it if you plan on having multiple courses, but we understand that the information around this might not have been clear. We'll make sure to better communicate this in the future to avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your wife's discomfort. While we take food safety and quality seriously, we're glad that you didn't experience any issues yourself.

You explicitly order two burgers and waiter brings you one, forgetting about second.

The name is a bit misleading; it is beyond heavenly and nothing like the average \""falafel\"" you might think of. It's the best vegan burger I've had. The burger itself is self-made from actual vegetables, so none of the \""fake meat\"" stuff there; it has a sufficient amount of sauce in it as opposed to almost any other burger I've had in the NL; the grilled vegetables are genius and make it even more juicy; it just tasted so amazing! It's also big!\n\nJust make sure to eat the burger with cutlery, otherwise it will be all over the plate.\n\nI'd be happy to see another vegan burger on the menu too, as well as a vegan dessert. The place itself isn't the most cozy, but your burger-y needs will surely be fulfilled!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-29T23:10:32"",""response_from_owner_text"":""thank you, glad to hear you enjoy our falafel burger!"",""response_from_owner_ago"":""a month ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2024-12-13T14:34:21"",""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURraTQzOXFnRRAB"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Steena"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104773979657881026907?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Busy when I visited but service staff and kitchen were efficient and seemed to support each other well.\n\nA small menu with a good offering.

We walked in (after having tried some other restaurants, but without a reservation on a Friday night...it gets difficult in Amsterdam). We were seated at the bar and gladly took it. At first I felt a bit overlooked, but our waiter quickly realized that and offered us some extra bread on the house. Normally, I wouldn't get excited about bread but the smoked almond/garlic butter they pair it with is just delicious. After a while we were even offered a table seat and continued our dinner there. The food is scrumptious!\n\nThe dishes are all prepared with care and were amazing. The wine was surprisingly well-priced and our waiters each gave us amazing warm service. Our waiter Nikos had great recommendations for the food and even for a coffee place in the morning. We felt pampered all evening. I can greatly recommend the smoked eel and foie gras, the scallops and ribeye. Don't forget to order a side of mashed potato with bone marrow- it is really good.\n\nI was even surprised about the desserts; sometimes it can be an afterthought, but at Maris Piper each dessert was well balanced and brought their own personality. The baba is light, has a rly nice orange like presence, the baked Alaska had an amazingly lemony meringue, and the chocolate was rich and dense. Beautiful!

The staff were polite, though the service lacked a certain attentiveness.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience was overshadowed by a few key issues. Despite having a reservation at 8:15 PM and arriving on time, we were seated at 8:20 PM and didn't start eating until 10:20 PM. Waiting over two hours for food is simply unacceptable. When the dishes finally arrived, they were lukewarm, which detracted significantly from the enjoyment. For example, the onion soup had excellent flavor but was served cold, and as a result, it was hard to appreciate fully.\n\nAnother concern was the portion sizes. The onion soup was more like half a dish, not even a full serving, and the portion of fries was tiny--barely half the small container they brought to the table. For the price and presentation, the portion sizes were disappointing and left us unsatisfied.\n\nWhile the restaurant has potential with its ambiance and flavors, the delays, cold food, and small portions made the overall experience underwhelming.

From Mexico to Amsterdam
How it all came to be...

It all started in 2001 when Los Pilones opened the doors at Kerkstraat 63 and introduced authentic Mexican cuisine in The Netherlands!

Los Pilones is a Mexican cantina style concept, serving fresh home made food and drinks in a colourful and vibrant atmosphere - a fiesta straight from Mexico to Amsterdam. You can drop in for tacos, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, fresh margaritas, micheladas, over 200 different kinds of 100% agave tequilas and mezcal.

Pilon in Mexico means ""a little extra"" and that is exactly what we intend to give you when you visit Los Pilones!",,1742,4.3,"[{""name"":""Tacos &

We ordered 6 things (and we got a extra olive oil type of bread as service) and then also 3 drinks. So we ordered pizza margarita that was simply delicious and it was also freshly made I could see it since they have an open kitchen. The lobster pasta was definitely overrated especially for that price it had a sea taste with tomatoes I mean it was nice but the thing that disappointed me was the fact that the lobster meat was only in pasta but not in the lobster itself the shelf was just there for the look so I couldn't taste the real lobster taste. I added the chili olive oil that was on the table to the pasta to give the flavor more depth. Than we also ordered the truffle roasted potatoes were delicious. They had a nice crispy outside and soft in the inside had a lot of flavor you could smell and taste the truffle perfectly. Then bread was very nice as service it was nice but very greasy but that's the purpose of the dish so can't complain it was very nice it kinda reminded me of Turkish bread dipped in olive oil. They unfortunately didn't had a lot of desert options the ice cream (gelato) was simply delicious but they could've added more like spectacular less boring flavors. The flan was okay it was nice but again nothing spectacular. The drinks were very mid we had virgin mojitos but instead of using sprite they used water so the lime taste was strong. They didn't had a lot of mocktails as option so that was unfortunate. But besides that service and food was nice and the place looked stunning as well. This might be one of the best Italians spots in Amsterdam even tho it's more on the expensive side."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-09T22:43:05"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOh1lF8yndQlk5Fz-VMVuXQlFZfizrgrg40Lozv=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNiqBPhvSAqiN0DqPDEqJ_1DRyFqKPC26i5prG9=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPoAEjCtarUdQsIA3oQ9bVhUOtL_-A2mG4JZsBZ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNKX5fCaMuIyLHXNOnhohwQGd0HxR2btfTy-V71=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPPb37CmwsD71PpirT4rZuK4fELt8B34VCLLuV5=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMgSp20SjOCdzndc4HdI12KRjctoqoeUVXNYTt6=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIcGNEWkV3EAE"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Clara"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116025781695368177880?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""The food left us with a really bad indigestion, it was hard to figure out which dish was responsible (maybe the beef tartare ?).

truly impresses from start to finish. As someone familiar with the richness and tradition of Turkish food, I knew the real test of a restaurant like this would be in the quality of their meat--and Orontes De Pijp exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe mixed grill, a hallmark of any Turkish dining experience, was a standout dish. The meat was perfectly cooked: tender, juicy, and packed with flavor that highlighted the mastery of their chefs. Every bite of lamb, chicken, and beef was full of rich, authentic taste, and it was clear that careful attention had gone into marinating and grilling the meats to perfection. The balance of spices was impeccable, enhancing the natural flavors without overwhelming them.\n\nBeyond the food, the service was warm and attentive, delivered by a staff that clearly takes pride in their craft. The passion for food and hospitality was evident in every aspect of the meal. Whether you're a seasoned lover of Turkish cuisine or new to it, Orontes De Pijp is an unforgettable experience that transports you straight to the heart of Turkey through its remarkable dishes and genuine service.

best steakhouses in Amsterdam, offering a fantastic variety of steak options, burgers, and a great selection of wines and alcohol. We enjoyed a delicious steak paired with an excellent French wine, making for a memorable meal.\n\nThe customer service was outstanding, and the atmosphere was inviting, especially at night when the city comes alive.

My wife even said it was better than some of the fondues we have had in Switzerland!\n\nI had the fish and chips and my wife had the burger--both were very good (along with the beers!) and the staff was helpful and attentive.\n\nAs I said above, the only negative was the length of time to receive our main courses, about 1 hour.\n\nI had seen another couple receive the same order we had (fish and chips, burger) and after about an hour, I was about to ask the staff about our order but before I could, our order was brought out to us.  The food was very tasty and piping hot so it was freshly prepared.\n\nEven though we were eating well before the normal dinner time, it could have been just a surge of customers.

The food was is worse than mediocre compared to other locations. The service is non-existence and staffs appear not care about customers at all.\n\nFirst, waited to be seated for at least 5 mins at the entrance without any greeting or attention, even though the hostess literally walked by several times without even acknowledge our existence!! She absolutely does not even care!! Note that there are 5 staffs on the floor and 4 cooks behind the counter.\n\nSecond, ordered the \""tom yum ramen\"", the dish portion is very small, even compare to those wagamama I have been in UK or Belgium. Furthermore, the dish is not ramen at all, it is flat white noodle! It's absolutely a joke! The most ridiculous is.... the dish is supposed to be with prawns, but, size of those are so small that they should not even considered as shrimp, let alone being called prawns! Then, the appetizer came after the main, which once again shown that the staffs just DO NOT CARE!\n\nThe cashier, probably the owner, asked me for feedback when I paid the bill at the front at the end. I did provide some candid feedback on portions/sizes of the dish! He was nice enough to give me a small discount on the bill.\n\nThis location does need a lot of improvement to live up with other wagamama locations in Europe."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-02T16:43:00"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear James,\n\nI sincerely apologize for the disappointing experience you had at our Amsterdam Centraal Station location.
