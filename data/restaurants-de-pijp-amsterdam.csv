truly impresses from start to finish. As someone familiar with the richness and tradition of Turkish food, I knew the real test of a restaurant like this would be in the quality of their meat--and Orontes De Pijp exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe mixed grill, a hallmark of any Turkish dining experience, was a standout dish. The meat was perfectly cooked: tender, juicy, and packed with flavor that highlighted the mastery of their chefs. Every bite of lamb, chicken, and beef was full of rich, authentic taste, and it was clear that careful attention had gone into marinating and grilling the meats to perfection. The balance of spices was impeccable, enhancing the natural flavors without overwhelming them.\n\nBeyond the food, the service was warm and attentive, delivered by a staff that clearly takes pride in their craft. The passion for food and hospitality was evident in every aspect of the meal.

To summarize, it didn't feel very clean, especially the kitchen and the floors, which is an open kitchen by the way. While I was trying to take some photos, someone told me I couldn't take pictures of the kitchen. Having an open kitchen and then telling customers not to photograph it is a big contradiction in my opinion, and a bit absurd. But of course, it's the establishment's rule, so I respect that.\n\nI'm not a fan of mixed omelets, so I played it safe and ordered scrambled eggs with sausages.

However, the actual taste of the food was shockingly bad.\n\nThe flavors were completely off, with ingredients that didn't complement each other at all. The sauce, in particular, was absolutely revolting--it genuinely felt like someone had puked into the dish rather than enhanced it. It was so unappetizing that we couldn't finish a single dish we ordered.\n\nI understand that some people in the Netherlands might be used to praising unconventional flavor combinations, but this was beyond that--it was just inedible.

Food presentation, Service, and the FLAVORS, which top up the indulgent gastronomical feast. This is my first Michelin experience, and my family could not have chosen a better place for my induction into this exclusive experience.\n\nThe owner chef of SINNE is Swedish Greek. The pride and the personal touch shows in every aspect of your meal. SINNE means Senses in Swedish, and it's definitely an experience for all the gastronomy senses. Delicious food, plated in earthy and charming crockery, with our attentive hostess bringing new cutlery with every Course. I really should have taken a photo of the menu, to explain it all better, however the menu changes with the seasons, with a new one expected in a couple of weeks.\n\nOur hostess was the lovely, and attentive Anna Leos (pronounced Anna Loosh) who described every detail of every dish of our Six Course meal. So there was all the finesse of gastronomy to look forward to, and we relished discovering every ingredient pop with taste on our tongues. The bartender was also very attentive, cheerful and cordial. Between him and Anna Leos, we felt very welcome guests. The photos do not do justice.\n\nOn arrival we got a complementary Amuse Bouche, actually two different presentations, which really set the bar high for what was to come. Every course promised to be my favorite, till the next one came..and our appetites and tummies were both in food heaven. Finally, it was time for our dessert. What came was another Amuse Bouche, so by the end of our meal we had enjoyed 9 Courses! Of course, the dessert was just as spectacular as the rest of our menu choices. Between us we tasted everything on the menu, and every dish was par excellence!\n\nFor me personally, it was an experience to cherish, and I would easily pay more for the food we ate, the service and the easy and relaxed ambiance of SINNE. Other members of the family enjoyed their wine, having ordered the same bottle as on their last visit here. For me there was a fabulous non alcoholic Rhubarb drink, which paired perfectly with my dessert.\n\nIt's easy to see why SINNE has held it's Michelin rating for the last 9 years. It will be no surprise that it completes a decade when Michelin announces the list again very soon for 2024."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-29T20:39:02"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPkY_fpg25DLUNv5Dp-NejiTtYeCxqtJutm_cdC=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPqfCYB-rPAd6xc1Es0eYwmaOzZhlxtZHwdprON=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN0R0Jd3NTPn_Tbw9m_5kLFyrtUSHvEpzQUOmwA=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPQF0sanplWMMtAXySEyhSHJ61QQRq8nvh8ePCc=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNmmFqmUUQed_h8t_vR8TAERhKi2N79tupyCFa4=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOaxFANrS5kieP9VVaTt6NSs2cZLHxQeeEefxN8=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM1OrBRpRFVAQXKsDDrrtmLEXnSdtaXkoWUeBsS=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNCNySeK413lpWnfYFcctTqdy2ojLOhCT716MVR=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOGoFNLjMmtDYjZ1EWt0J3ZVm6L2FsWnPahHvx3=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPfK6-kqhzi7ZIDzXxMyX44_H67JobSBcQ2a86Q=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPxKVCvYI_CD7cmDB31rLP6cxRXf3pD-HldoQBL=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPY_W326pKVbtZ26WSyEdLxgCx9MvZyjJlBAPFM=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPJmf0EA-1GH69gzQ6JR_3JvfzG_GGk9njkXfHD=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNjVfIKPDrPooMMFfiBfRp6dHT4QglRvui3uF8s=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOJWy-unA29edn6t5Xgrn6nP39fTwpi0Lk4XMcf=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMbFBRnWqLurT4zcQUNXBxKoBwdY2yQtL1QxiHc=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMqzGsKwqPEEpfCOJc58yDykpy6_CtKYTgQaGMq=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNCsK2u2R_KzkdUdv7F1FdKzdCi7mjLsmY-Phv4=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMalphdVRREAE"",""rating"":3,""name"":""Jeroen Razoux Schultz"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108792999695214640739?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Visited during the Dining with the Stars month.

Tables are positioned uncomfortably close to each other. Staff was friendly but could not conceal a certain level of stress and seemed to lack experience (a long coat was hung on the bottom part of the closet draping the coat over the floor). The food and paired wines...really underwhelming. Foamy, crunchy but absolutely no intensity.

We walked in (after having tried some other restaurants, but without a reservation on a Friday night...it gets difficult in Amsterdam). We were seated at the bar and gladly took it. At first I felt a bit overlooked, but our waiter quickly realized that and offered us some extra bread on the house. Normally, I wouldn't get excited about bread but the smoked almond/garlic butter they pair it with is just delicious. After a while we were even offered a table seat and continued our dinner there. The food is scrumptious!\n\nThe dishes are all prepared with care and were amazing. The wine was surprisingly well-priced and our waiters each gave us amazing warm service. Our waiter Nikos had great recommendations for the food and even for a coffee place in the morning. We felt pampered all evening. I can greatly recommend the smoked eel and foie gras, the scallops and ribeye. Don't forget to order a side of mashed potato with bone marrow- it is really good.\n\nI was even surprised about the desserts; sometimes it can be an afterthought, but at Maris Piper each dessert was well balanced and brought their own personality. The baba is light, has a rly nice orange like presence, the baked Alaska had an amazingly lemony meringue, and the chocolate was rich and dense. Beautiful!

Both were equally good, making it a tough pick for next time.\n\nThe place is a bit on the small side and the service could be friendlier, but the good food makes up for it."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-06-20T16:39:35"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMbblwR2blHFlcAiskGLqHNDAidpC2CLLqpskot=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOlwiVpVTsE7iuL5Uc3OFdM6voonQFTT4jPfU-d=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMtNd2316yQS6HuJghw-QCNebiJa0b3eX5k2SDi=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMQVDBeObINhu3TdWWbu9IrIlcjHVMrvPWG9eUt=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6cF9MeUpnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Maria Garcia"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105405702802032418017?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""The burger was really good, also the fries.

I would also ask if a person wants it (extra) spicy. Mine had a lot of Tabasco without even asking and I loved it, but I'm not sure if everybody has the same preference as me.\n\nThe strawberry matcha is definitely a hit, if you can justify a high price tag for a small matcha (that  can be gone in a few sips) with some jam at the bottom :)\n\nThe coffee had a slight  burnt taste, so if you are looking for a mild and smooth coffee  - better order it somewhere else."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-05T13:57:47"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey Lika, thanks so much for taking the time to share your detailed feedback about your experience at Locals All Day Brunch!

As an extra gesture, the floor manager surprised us by removing the dish from the bill - something we only discovered when the check arrived. After we paid and tipped, they insisted we take another round of drinks to-go, on the house. For the second time, I enjoyed a matcha latte, and my husband a cappuccino - a thoughtful gesture that truly went above and beyond.\n\nThe team's humility and care made us feel deeply valued.

The restaurant boasts a great ambiance that immediately puts you at ease. The friendly personnel, all of them exuding a warm smile and welcoming attitude, made the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nThe food itself was a delight. Notably, the prices were reasonable.\n\nCasa Nostra offers a variety of typical dishes. Being surrounded by almost all Italian staff truly made me feel like I was right at home.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was a tad smaller than expected, leading to a somewhat noisy environment that occasionally made it challenging to maintain a focused conversation.\n\nMy only significant point of improvement was with the seating. Despite making reservations in advance, my party was assigned higher-than-average bar stools, which deviated from my preferred seating type. It would be fantastic if Casa Nostra considers offering a choice of seating options in the future.\n\nThe outside terrace exuded a charming and cozy ambiance, making it an attractive option for pleasant weather.\n\nI'll definitely be returning for another taste of Italy in Amsterdam!"",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-08-18T12:27:33"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMX-BYznb4lFRKbHdRYJpyaKbq25zs3sOEYINOw=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP2LiSl2AntujwZ7nEZLsmGDoNn5DxBhluh4yn1=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPz3gUQKkJXDlUsbIzstscZRqVPGRBNWvXg7PBI=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN0tM6JG3Z2S-4EeFSCGKIMRtspXzw_3bNSANqE=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMJYF7vJWxCSeEksWofb3q1StvjJctPYDv3C2tk=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURycXJhN0RREAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Ivan Stepanin"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115033518195396383436?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""One of the best Italian restaurants in Amsterdam.

I have experienced better Mediterranean cuisine at a fraction of the cost elsewhere.\n\nWhile the atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant and the staff polite, the food itself just didn't justify the high prices.

We learned quickly that restaurants stop serving food to prep for dinner and only offer snacks or bites so that is what we got since we were starving. Tried bitterballen for the first time (pictured below). It was different, but we didn't hate it. The real star was the nachos. They were so GOOD. I am a lover of nachos and these tasted so fresh. I wish I knew where they got the chips or if they made them because they were the tastiest tortilla chips I have ever had. Definitely order those! As for service, we had a very friendly server. He seated us inside due to the patio being full but as soon as a spot opened he cleared it and moved us outside. Overall, it was a nice experience and it is a great spot to stop for a bite and to chat. We did not order an actual meal so I cannot speak on that which is why I just put 4 stars. Plus, even though it was between meals, it was still pretty busy. Either way, check it out if you can and get the NACHOS!"",""published_at"":""7 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-05-27T08:01:19"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNPIMQVk985ylR7LcNROvHDghINy2cp4YXGQtgx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMrZ4CqKzZbsRhnpFkHC6gS7H8HRH-pVswDLuXt=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuZ2FYVElnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Emily T"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103354676362891748567?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Such a lovely place for brunch/lunch!

We came here based on the reviews and boy, we were not disappointed. The overall vibe of the place is pretty nice and calm, the place has an aesthetic to it that is really unique. Orders are placed downstairs and the seating is upstairs where you have a view of the entrance. We ordered 2 Franggo menu 2 Half chicken with mix sauce (peri-peri/garlic butter lemon) and a side of rice and jacket potato. We waited for around 7 mins the food arrived the chicken tasted amazing tender and well-done with that sauce, it wasn't very spicy for us but had pleasant mild heat and a kick of sour from the lemon in the sauce. The jacket potato was really tasty as well it was dressed with butter lemon and herbs. The rice to my surprise had a distinctive flavour that reminded me of the my mom's rice I ate back home, I couldn't resist to eat it in its own, you can also drizzle on some of the sauce that comes with the chicken \n\nImportant to mention, the staff are really nice and friendly and the service was amazing. The waiter served us 2 pieces of Pastel de nata to make up for  \""long wait\"" which was only 7 mins (we definitely waited more than that in previous experiences) a gesture I really appreciated from the staff and tells that they really care.\nWe finished with the our free pastel de natas which were creamy form the inside with crusty flaky crust. I highly recommend getting one when you visit.\nI will definitely be back on my next visit to Amsterdam."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-08-12T17:41:39"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP4H5o46djasgE3DSxIDFkSvDqNSVq29lyFywez=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM-GLkBE53UKkZYFyXNjTsoLFs91BhDXf53tIp0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP85qqecHx23JKWavhGjyAGhcdWXY3mFlBAgepZ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNJ0vbEKdmjb6kgtLlFX-HaXMzyaaG3n-Kv9mVz=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPb9md8psGjcBlG5bJkafpRWHAwNpTTqh2NyklH=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNma3FyVURREAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Archil Kublashvili"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117910002649918621563?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Really nice spot, relaxing atmosphere with nothing fancy, yet cozy enough to feel yourself in the center of Lisbon.\n\nGood food, good service, superb location!

With this change in demand the supply of delicious vegan food options has mushroomed. The Vegan Junk Food Bar is a top choice for great vegan food. The servers are friendly and efficient. The burgers are top notch. The tastiest non-meat patties I've ever had. The fries and sauces are great compliments for your main meal and the beer options are nothing to be sneered at. The options from Two Chefs brewing are some of the best I've had. The Betterballs are so flavoursome, with extremely crispy outer layers that reveal a creamy, mouth-watering inside.

The main issue was the rude behavior of one of the waiters who wasn't serving us directly but was the one who seated us at our table. When we were leaving, he insisted on closing the door, presumably because of the cold. The problem? My child was still inside, and we hadn't exited yet! It was an unnecessary and rude interaction that really soured the entire experience.\n\nOn top of that, the service was overall disappointing. It felt like we were invisible to the staff, possibly because we came with children. It seemed like they had little patience for our kids, who, of course, didn't eat the food like adults. They were expected to sit quietly without any leeway, and when they pulled out a snack they same rude waiter told us it wasn't allowed. I get it, but it's kids. Why wouldn't you have something for kids then to order? It's impossible to order 3-4 course meal for kids with snails. It's frustrating when a family-friendly atmosphere is missing, and you're treated like an inconvenience.\n\nAdditionally, I never been served a food where the waiter just pass me the plate and I have to put it on the table on my own. Come on is it restaurant recommended by Michelin guide or a fast food chain where they don't pay attention on how they serve the food?! If you a restaurant it's a huge mistake and unacceptable.\n\nAs for the food, it was just okay--not terrible, but nothing memorable either. Given the lack of hospitality and the general unwelcoming vibe, I honestly don't think it's worth the visit if you're in Amsterdam! We were really looking forward to a great meal and a pleasant experience, but sadly it's just not the case.

There was loud music playing and many many people . Maybe he was overwhelmed.\n\nWhy couldn't he just say so kindly . Use his words instead of his passive-aggressive body language.  He walked away and didn't even say anything to me after doing that . Like it was my purpose to ruin his night by not knowing that they WANTED TO USE card board coasters on the old dirty tables.\n\nIt's literally run down. No new decor. I thought it was the actually vibe of the place. The wooden tables and chairs with no cloths. Barely any lighting.  I chose it cause it looked less fancy than the other 20 restaurants in the area that sell Heineken.\n\nAfter that interaction, I left and didn't bother ordering food. It was my first time there . No one is walking into restaurants choosing to be rude. Waiters need to stop acting like foreigners are traveling just to irk them.

You can't really tell from the outside, but the inside is HUGE and it has 4 different floors! The best thing about this cafe is the cozy atmosphere, very hipster and bohemian. The coffee and food were delicious, but not amazing. I would not necessarily come back for that. Also, the service could be better. We were waiting to get placed while the staff were just chatting amongst each other. After that the staff did proactively asked us with what we wanted to drink. But for ordering food we had to wait a while until we signed them. And after ate our food, they never came back asking how the food was or if we wanted another drink. It as a shame, because if they have kindly asked, we would have another drink as we sat long enough - which is a lost income for them. Also the staff didn't seem smiling or happy, which also makes a huge difference in how the service is.

We're delighted you enjoyed the food but are disappointed by your rating, given the situation.\n\nWhen booking through our website, the seating options are clearly stated, including whether the table is located indoors or outdoors. You specifically selected outdoor seating. At the time of your visit, we were fully booked indoors, which is why we were unable to move you inside upon arrival.\n\nWhile we understand that sitting outside during autumn can be chilly, we do our best to provide transparent seating information during the booking process so guests can choose their preferred option. For future visits, we recommend booking an indoor table earlier to ensure availability, especially during peak times.\n\nWe hope you'll give us another opportunity to serve you, and we'll do our utmost to make your next experience even better."",""response_from_owner_ago"":""a month ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2024-11-23T18:38:10"",""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMN5WFQ0oyvZ0MYEwvDkrmron1zU0qqyNYUOSYX=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN_r1_er5i1RgvOD7wqi6MRKMvWdaRRJma6KEDi=s1024""]}]",[],restaurants de pijp amsterdam

Toppings were edamame, pumpkin, red onion, cucumber.\nThe avocado topping was perfect, not too hard, not too ripe.\nPickled radish topping was also nice.\nIt was also a big surprise because they just added ACAI / ACAI in the dessert menu, so we were really happy. We got strawberries, banana, blueberries and granola as toppings. The flavour was very soft and the texture was perfect.

The Spang Makandra Special at 16.50 was a steal, huge portion.\n\nIt had both noodles and rice, it had beans, red onions and more. Everything was flavourful. We enjoyed it all.\n\nWe tried the soup- saoto soup. A little salty but otherwise flavourful. Happy we tried it. The fried banana with the sate sauce (Bakabana) was also better than I expected and price wise, quite good.\n\nThe only item that didn't work out was the drink. It was a bottled drink (not made by the restaurant) that had a sweet but almost chemical flavour. Gingabirie. Nope, it didn't suit my palate."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-19T17:04:01"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOC7N1jLBf8CH47ix0K-swauqAVh1aVGJGuC8vf=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNpO95HLCeewi2SIUts1FK_jRZVYRpHjCDc_KmR=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN9dFkA-8liNsAzd7-q_IFUHKVm2H7vD51LX-9_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM-jK7Ep2b5YM7FSPW7acay9ys3J4nMh3NjI9qe=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO0RwDLiiP8icmU9SqaVspMzX5dTHfC79b0Li7h=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOqXllLIOx2orDkIX67N4mOcAN7UGimq0E7t1Ak=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN8Co6nM81eRPr17vKrLscWKQZhahaAGst0ivza=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOD9QcBnpQj-EQkcyp3NVHbeZp1GPwpIr0urCuJ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNvPaAzI_yZszHzMc4mkMaxg3twQAnYKb-TDR5U=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMpcSUQwINvZS6cRGofP962zYD8-v7aXD_wGqlH=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPdKM1dQjVZFrFTKkZpvtJd4iiWkdfx_wLsp4CZ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPsS2EcU1XuDXn9tA7N04x6ESSfL44npUePmNwU=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMZnt7PWd3nA3obkWgNNalf1KHbxjktT-WLC_jz=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPzK9tyMM8XP9q7PXHHls7kBGEvuePqSJjl9ibw=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPjdhzRfjHxVczDqweHZXrMj4C5PLhEbqr2xnc7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOVL_f9YzPhmS2QQvBZUURA_uXvgmRJwRfayTKR=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNVnI6v8PuVjjjaWaeKozqNiftGV5Faba1srJ-E=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNcaOAy77W4cJBheLWgcm9Hg6rGWl8o5J8NtU7J=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOu0EJvlruvgMsKXjHBmj-E-fuyRFmWiCKCqcv2=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOz9tC7ZYep951qtF0teS2yv-D1TCP712azotgy=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNouZAMloymcxeLtuMYY_yQ4Tdy_Ef7wlh6lOQG=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP5Ut5F4ZUbjq1M8JGQiPJB_6TyP0q9tNSM3O2G=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYb1o3NEFREAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Hong Van Chu"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100156521562843853293?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""It was our first time trying surinamese food and it was a fantastic experience!

Together with a juice, which was delicious, it costed a bit over 20EU. Honestly, they should be ashamed to provide such a poor quality food for this amount, especially when almost any restaurant can serve a good vegan burger nowadays...the stuff is constantly talking about how they want to be over with their shift in full voice, which brings a bitter taste to already not so good meal..."",""published_at"":""8 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-04-25T08:35:03"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

Surprisingly, the place wasn't very busy, with only three other tables occupied, which I didn't expect given the positive things I'd heard about it.\n\nWe were seated and greeted promptly, but the service afterward was disappointing. Despite having so few customers, it took some time for anyone to come and take our order. There seemed to be only two staff members working--one at the counter and one serving tables--but I didn't expect it to take so long, especially considering how quiet it was. We eventually had to call the waiter ourselves to let them know we were ready, which felt odd since most restaurants check in with you after some time.\n\nAdding to the inattentiveness, a nearby table that had finished eating before we arrived still had dirty plates left on it even when we left, which gave the impression of poor attention to detail.\n\nThat said, the food was absolutely delicious and saved the experience for us. Every dish we ordered was well-prepared and enjoyable. However, great food alone isn't enough when the service feels this unorganized.\n\nI'd still recommend this place for the food, but I hope they work on improving their service. With better attentiveness and efficiency, this spot could easily be a standout."",""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-02T23:01:40"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for your detailed review, Quisha!

She was incredibly polite and promptly checked with the chef manager in the kitchen.\n\nTo my utter shock, the Italian chef came out and began yelling at me, insisting that nothing could be done about my mistake. He continued to scream, even as I stood there in disbelief at his reaction. I calmly asked him to stop, but he persisted. The staff, who appeared just as shocked as I was, looked on helplessly.\n\nI informed the chef that his behavior had cost them a loyal customer who had previously enjoyed many visits to Sushito. I have worked in the hospitality industry for ten years and have never encountered such unprofessional and aggressive conduct from a staff member.\n\nThis experience has completely soured my view of Sushito, and I will not be returning.

He made customised meal for our baby as she suddenly started to cry(because of teething issues). He personally comes & ask if we need any help just let him know that was really sweet of him. & Now about food... We have never tasted this kind of Naan in Indian also. It was so thin & full of flavour directly from Tandoor. Very few restaurants serve with fresh traditional tandoori items but this is the place. Delhi style butter chicken is simply yummylicious. Not just sweet but flavourful. don't forget to try their fresh lime soda with freshly squeezed lemon. Highly recommended.  Thank you so much! Gonna visit this place again \n\nVisit 2- This place never gonna disappoint you. Make a reservation & give feast to yourself, pamper your tastebuds tried mixed grill....it was deliciously flavoursome & that too from coal Tandoor(clay oven).

ChIJo_ULDJIJxkcRjZlNuOdbI4c,Arles,"Arles is a modern bistro located in a quiet side street of the Amsterdamse Pijp. Just like in the Parisian 'bistronomy' scene, you will find creative dishes in an accessible and artistic environment.

 Numa Muller, our chef from Arles, creates a new 4 and 5 course chef's menu every month (a la carte is also possible). His neo-bistro dishes are surprising because of the special combinations of French cuisine with outside influences.

 We have an entirely French wine list with an interesting composition of traditional producers, as well as emerging vins nature.

excellent service. The staff is professional, friendly, and well-informed, creating an enjoyable dining experience.\n\nHowever, I was somewhat disappointed with the food, especially considering the price. We opted for the chef's five-course tasting menu, which included three appetizers, one main course, and a dessert.\n\nThe first two appetizers were outstanding, the scallop, and the mushrooms in chestnut cream; but the third, a fried croquette, felt uninspired, with the flavor dominated entirely by the frying. The main course, featuring venison, was delicious; however, the addition of two small pieces of eel felt out of place and did not harmonize with the rest of the dish.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect, unfortunately, was the dessert. The menu included a pear-based dessert accompanied by parsley ice cream. While innovative, the flavors were peculiar and didn't align with what one would expect for a dessert course. Unsatisfied, I asked to try the second dessert option, which was cottage cheese-based. Sadly, this too failed to impress and did not feel like a fitting conclusion to an otherwise refined meal. For the price I paid I would have expected more.\n\nIn summary, while the menu shows great promise, certain elements could be improved. I would strongly recommend revisiting the dessert selection to ensure a more satisfying ending to an otherwise well-thought-out dining experience."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-18T11:51:55"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey there, Enrico Verdolotti!

You sit right in the open kitchen and get to watch the chef prepare each dish of the tasting menu--a wonderful, immersive experience!\n\nThe menu is full of delightful surprises--from the Sake Panna Cotta, which is a silky, slightly sweet starter, to the Saffron Brioche Feuilletee that feels indulgent yet light. A standout dish has to be the North Sea Crab, which you can elevate with a supplement of Perle Imperial Caviar. It's seafood perfection, but at a price! The Nigiri Langoustine keeps things playful and interesting, and the Dry Aged Turbot with Sambelzu has incredible depth of flavor. Even the Seaweed Dessert is a conversation starter--something unexpected but totally fitting with the meal.\n\nFor EU77.50, this creative menu offers great value for its unique ingredients and intimate experience.

Super worth it!\n\nMy only critique is that the dishes could have been described with more pride and passion by our server. She spoke a bit fast and I could not fully retain everything.

De jaarcapaciteit was 100.000 liter en dat werd allemaal ter plekke opgedronken. In 2015 vergrootte we de productie capaciteit met een nieuwe brouwerij op het Westergasterrein. Momenteel is Brouwerij Troost De Pijp de plek waar we experimenteren, nieuwe bieren ontwikkelen en de bieren met kleine oplages produceren.

Bij bier moet goed gegeten worden en dat kan ook bij Brouwerij Troost. De keuken van Brouwerij Troost De Pijp is open tot 22:30 uur om de lekkerste hamburgers, salades, bitterballen, Libanese pizettes, nacho's, cheesecakes en nog heel veel meer voor je te

At the end as we enjoyed our teas (with a few refills and much obsession for these sweet treats) the staff brought us out a small bowl which was so kind!

We were there to celebrate our anniversary. The waiter first confirmed our reservation and congrats to us. During the diner, the staff are friendly, checking with us is everything okay, how is the serving speed, would we like to have a chill break before having the dessert etc. Right before we left, the staff congrats us again, really sweet. Our chief is great, she is kind, keep smiling while I cannot imagine how heavy the work she is doing, constantly cooking for us for 3 hours almost.\n\nThe Atmosphere is really great too. It has soft lighting, decorated with traditional Japanese style.\n\nNow come to the most important part for me. The FOOD, it is amazing. We chose the Classic menu.\n* Started with Tuna tataki (I am too focus on the food and forgot to take picture for it). It has beautifully caramelized crust but super tender inside.\n* Then come with Seasalt crusted sea bass. The crust looks interesting too, it looks like puffed pancake, asked the chief, it is 90% salf and 10% whisked egg. The fish filet stays juicy with the Seasalt crust on top. The chief bake the fish skin separately, make it super crispy (I love chips, also fish chips)\n* The 3rd course is Canadian lobster with Yuzu garlic butter. Beside those 3 words: lobster + garlic + butter, what do we need to say more. (Spoil alert: it come with the fire show)\n* Wagyu steak is definitely the high light of the course. It come with 3 \""sauce\"", himalayan salt, Japanese wasabi and one more (I forgot the name, but that's my favorite match with the Wagyu among all 3) Its provide a bit freshness to compensate well with the grease of Waygu. Btw it come with grilled zucchini and paprika too (I love grilled vegetables!!!!) It also come with some baked Wagyu fat part too. I expect it would be crispy, but the bigger pieces is not crispy enough though (small details)\n* The Chicken fried rice served together with the Wagyu. Do not get my wrong, it is tasty too, but having it together with Wagyu, I could not finish it eventually. Personally I am not a fan of having rice together with steam\n* The desert: Sazanka pancake (Dorayaki, one my favorite sweets, I love red bean paste ) the Japanese ice cream served with it is Matcha icecream. Personally, I do not like dessert to be too sweet, so leave the syrup aside. The Dorayaki is perfect with Matcha together\n* Extra: we also got an extra dessert on the house for the Congratulation"",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-22T19:36:43"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Ruiling Zhang,\n\nThank you so much for your detailed and wonderful review of Teppanyaki Restaurant Sazanka. \n\nWe are delighted to hear that you chose to celebrate your anniversary with us and that we could contribute to making it a special occasion.\n\nWe are thrilled that you appreciated the warm welcome from our team and the attentive service throughout your dinner.

The vegan cheese was blend and tasteless, and nowadays there are good ones.\n\nIf we would have had a good experience for sure we would return during our stay (a week), but after all that happened there is no way.

It's important to keep in mind that music taste is really subjective, so blasting Italian pop music is not ideal.\nEverything else was great though so keep it up!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-24T10:06:41"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2cWZLRG5BRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Karolina Lindblad"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114752358256179400508?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""really good pizza maybe one of the best in amsterdam and the service was amazing felt like I was in Rome again (home)"",""published_at"":""3 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-21T18:06:08"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNJJQ6APTRkt8uZyz8aa13-6i-pOHU8CQENcdiG=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPhRCiqIQ4-L8yklevsSPPP6SHuQkYRnigaxrK0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOUzm6EBiDSeDk6HHbptSr8NES2mZB-RJBQGN13=s1024""]}]",[],restaurants de pijp amsterdam

don't want to miss! Their oyster selection is truly impressive, with six different types to explore, each more delicate and fresh than the last. Pairing them with one of their many crisp white wines or a glass of cava is a must--it elevates the whole experience.\n\nMoving on to the mains, the roasted razor clams and sauteed white clams were spot on. The flavors were bold but balanced, and the texture was just perfect. The calamari, though, might be the hidden hero--it's probably the best I've had in Amsterdam. It's got that tender, melt-in-your-mouth quality and comes with a sauce that's so rich and flavorful that you'll be wiping the plate clean.\n\nThen came the egg with caviar, and wow--it's a dish to remember. Luxurious, silky, and full of flavor, it felt like a little celebration of everything you could want in a seafood meal. The salad dishes were fresh and light, acting as the perfect counterbalance to the richness of the seafood.\n\nThe prices are admittedly on the steep side, but for a special occasion, Brut de Mer feels absolutely worth it. Plus, the friendly and attentive staff really add to the vibe, making the whole experience feel like a treat. If you're looking to indulge, this spot will hit all the right notes!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-01T08:15:57"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOoFXhv_I6209VwfnBN7BU7w9oesY2kMF6lxfdg=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOBXg4tjc-6sFpf_SUN6tIbmY8IzJZsIfJMxvZg=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP5xr4fipIoLInK5O9o0uEwMF8OnMWhfqKqh1Ba=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMueObGcrDwnC5SQ4fQ87q39DWG__ZxnUYvlgws=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMc6Ea6RZdIPTeq8FHK0bz37JrnfSz3jQ-Eq-p3=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMsvmAN45PsmOHHB5MgLe0eks8CAI1jNbWoGaUk=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOIbji15JbXIiev3ja5jZissQdvYdxvLP13bM8t=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOp7_lHmLNgpgSTXuFufDB2zDnk2E-Vm96E7G1p=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudk5yUVFnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Daniel Chak"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114188313514327272263?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Amazing seafood with a great vibe.

And then the bad experience started.\nAfter 1 hour despite we were the second small group to arrive, we had no food. The waitress was not giving us any attention. Like if everything was normal. I then asked the waiter who apologised and told us the food will arrive soon. We had food after more than 1 hour and 30 minutes... Just crazy.\nAfter the starter, the main and the desserts arrived on time. But surely because the waiter was doing the jobs of the two waitresses who were not professional at all and doing quite nothing.\nFood was good, but not exceptional for this price and quantity.\nIt was a bad experience and there is a lot of better Italian restaurants in Amsterdam, with a much better/professional service.\nThey accept all the credit cards."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-04-08T19:57:43"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Ciao Francois, thank you for the review.

unfortunately, it didn't meet expectations.\n\nThe burrata was decent, but at EU17.5, it was a simple dish with cherry tomatoes sliced in 2--overpriced for what it was.\nSurprised to be charged for tap water for my daughter (EU1,5), which felt unnecessary.\nThe Negroni (EU11) seemed hastily made, lacking attention to detail, no garnish (at least a slice of orange would do the job)\nThe entrecote, which I ordered rare, arrived overcooked and was quite small for the EU32 price tag. The quality of the meat was also not up to par.\nThey served focaccia without asking, and I was charged EU8.5 for it.\nEU11 for a simple vanilla ice cream, counted as an affogato, felt excessive.\n\nThe waiter was very pushy with extras, which of course reflected in the final bill. The one highlight was the nice chef, who made an excellent bolognese--delicious, well-served.\nSadly, the overall experience felt like being in a tourist trap where the goal is to pad the bill with unnecessary extras."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-28T14:09:46"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOMYGuMX5yaMXWXdQRCwkOt18bt_tvYXHfu7UGS=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOghalp8Dg3F94Qw1W2DTgsMEtofMlIiNm9yY7i=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMch-FgSC0xD6GqMool_fynNI2i0m4c89ucJ6IL=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNvpId_IxlvAcMs8sq6JSy58ea_kICPm9IOGRzP=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2X2JYQjh3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Jimi Hong"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111407703984569018985?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Why does this place not have higher ratings?

Since we are big fans of truffle, we ordered their signature Carletto Pasta, a tagliatelle dish covered in truffle and Parmigiano Reggiano. It was rich and the pasta had that perfect bite. We also shared the Tartafuta Pizza, which was equally delicious, with a crispy base and plenty of truffle flavor. To top it all off, we treated ourselves to the Chocolate Cheesecake for dessert, which was creamy and smooth.

I think the cauliflower bites were nice but I would change the accompanying dip from soy sauce to something more yogurt-based as soy is quite salty and becomes too much alongside the fried batter. The only thing I didn't like was the sweet potato mainly because there was some spice, not sure what exactly it was actually but it was giving a very strong smell.

I chose the restaurant due to its overwhelmingly positive reviews, but as an Asian, I was truly disappointed by the experience. It felt like a stereotypical Western, cheap take on what Asian food should be, and most dishes did not justify the price tag.\n\nFood: 1 star \n\nEvery dish was more disappointing than the last. Let's start with the basics: they provided us with poorly made disposable chopsticks in what is supposed to be a luxurious, high-class restaurant. Not only were the chopsticks low-quality, but they also left splinters after being split. I've had better ones with cheap Chinese takeout.\n\nSalmon, Yellowtail, and Seabass Sashimi - 24 euro -  1 star\n\nThis dish consisted of six thinly sliced pieces of fish heavily drenched in soy sauce with a hint of yuzu aroma, topped with green onion, ginger, and loads of sesame. The flavor profile worked slightly for the seabass, reminding me of Cantonese-style steamed fish. However, it completely ruined the yellowtail and salmon. The richness and fattiness of the fish were overpowered, leaving a dish that was far too salty and dominated by soy sauce.\n\nSalmon Avocado Uramaki (20.5 euro) / Shrimp Tempura Uramaki (19.5 euro) -  3 stars\n\nThese were the most ordinary dishes out of all we tried. They weren't bad, but there was nothing special about them in terms of presentation or taste. You can get the same quality at any average Western sushi shop. The rice was too wet and soft, and the rolls were somewhat sticky, but overall, these were the best dishes of the meal.\n\nBeef Toban Hibachi - 34 euro -  1 star\n\nThis dish featured six pieces of beef drenched in the same soy sauce with a hint of yuzu aroma, served on a hot plate. The outside of the meat was dry, chewy, and overly salty, while the inside was softer but tasteless. Eating it altogether resulted in a strange combination of overly salty and flavorless at the same time. The enoki mushrooms and single broccoli floret on the plate were also far too salty from being soaked in the sauce. Ironically, the single mushroom and single asparagus were the most delicious elements of the dish.\n\nRibeye with Anticucho Sauce - 44 euro -  1 star\n\nThe anticucho sauce tasted like yellow mustard mixed with taco seasoning and was drizzled over sliced ribeye rather than being grilled with it. The steak's texture was tender enough, but there was no caramelization or grilling that was detectable, leaving it overly saucy and salty. The beef itself was bland and lacked any depth of flavor.\n\nTea (Jasmine/Matcha) - 5.5 euro each -  2 stars\n\nThe tea was just a teabag served in a fancy teapot that didn't appear very clean. Even after half an hour of steeping, the matcha tea still had no flavor.\n\nService: 4 stars \n\nI deducted one star because of how understaffed they were. We visited on a Saturday lunchtime, and there was only one host, two waitresses, and a bartender managing the entire floor. While the host was nice and greeted us with a big smile, that's where the positives ended. There was an excessive amount of waiting between everything due to the lack of staff.\n\nWe had initially planned to order more after the first round, but given how disappointing everything was, we decided to leave. This was truly a letdown, and I would not recommend this restaurant. There are so many better options in Amsterdam for authentic, well-made Japanese food."",""published_at"":""2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-28T16:54:02"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear  Kim ,\nThank you for taking the time to review  IZAKAYA.

The dumplings were underwhelming. The spinach salad serves 2 pcs of shrimps, 1 per person.\n\nThe server whom took our order, his breath reeked of bile/puke as if they had a bad incident prior to coming to our table. This put off my appetite. Then upon taking our order, I asked about the fruits served together with the dessert due to my allergy to stone fruits. He was dismissive by responding: ''Its just a little bit'' ''Oh, but your partner can eat it for you'' ''Oh don't worry about it, its fine''. An allergy is an allergy and should be taken seriously.\n\nThe dishes were underwhelming and were overshadowed by the amount of Yuzu (citrus fruit) used in majority of the dishes. In the end, all we could taste was the Yuzu almost to the point of developing a Yuzu-phobia. When finishing the course menu, my partner jokingly mentioned that we are dining at Yuzu-kaya.\n\nThe atmosphere was welcoming and in general, the staff were attentive. Japanese-South american fusion was a nice attempt.
