We were lucky to be there for taco Tuesday so we managed to try multiple tacos for decent price. I would definitely recommend to go for tacos and quesadillas. Cocktails were very good too. Would love to highlight friendly and helpful service. Giulio was very accommodating and hospitable with all requests. He also was very kind and explained the concept and gave us good recommendations what to choose and try. Ambience also very lovely.

They also have their famous Taco Tuesday's same as in the US, when they make 2 extra taco's at a cheaper price than usual. Also they have a monthly taco that they change from time to time. The interior is very colorful and playfull. On the back of the bar there is a wide selection of different types of liquor.

We were sitting from 7-10pm and you are annoyed by cleaning stuff around you and smell of the market. Sitting inside it's better option but super small place. Average cocktail is 10-15 eur, that's typical Dutch price. They have frozen Margaritas 1 L, wondering who is ordering this since after 5 mins when is melted it's not drinkable.

From Mexico to Amsterdam
How it all came to be...

It all started in 2001 when Los Pilones opened the doors at Kerkstraat 63 and introduced authentic Mexican cuisine in The Netherlands!

Los Pilones is a Mexican cantina style concept, serving fresh home made food and drinks in a colourful and vibrant atmosphere - a fiesta straight from Mexico to Amsterdam. You can drop in for tacos, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, fresh margaritas, micheladas, over 200 different kinds of 100% agave tequilas and mezcal.

Pilon in Mexico means ""a little extra"" and that is exactly what we intend to give you when you visit Los Pilones!",,1742,4.3,"[{""name"":""Tacos &

a 10 mins tram ride away from Amsterdam Central, The restaurant is at a good location with lot of other restaurants around it as well. As we entered the restaurant we really liked the vibes. Songs with cool beats in the background, nice friendly ambiance, perfect for the evenings for sure. In drinks we ordered Mexican beer Dos Equis and Margarita Miss Picantona. From the bites we ordered Jalapeno poppers and Totopos. The bites were really yummy and we enjoyed them with the drinks. We then ordered Tacos (chicken and veg), it was also really nice in taste. For the next round of drinks we ordered Michelada Special (beer + tequila)  and it was really great as well. The staff at the restaurant is very friendly and always happy to help with the menu. Overall a good experience and worth going in the evenings. Good to have reservation as it can get busy.\n\nPS: Although, must add that we found the place a relatively pricey as compared to other restaurants. The food is quite overpriced."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-06-30T07:36:18"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN0btJAO2_eDsnrzvUaU-xrJ7mP2JvHEWo3nD6u=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPWNoEzYJHiRfrxHiycqdcNcxhRVvY8fJVDk7I_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOChBVyydwssMAZGJInoc1QFKHb_3TwfTHKAAea=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNDv9jaavA2Iac0ygTh4jcXM7gP25dqCP5KG99_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP-MWavCKPl1IoUAJt_Q-2tLe85tjwysRexOoDQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNx46f-3ejoZ_8FRHfRi2j7Xtir_-EPlcmKmbEk=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPK-KwDLZaq3mFQrQ5QHOTHNASZEfUx8C9kZOhy=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzeWFXVmh3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Anna Tulkis"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113033021691749413262?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Great restaurant!
