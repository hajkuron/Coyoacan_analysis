We ordered the pulled pork and chicken tacos, they were good, but not mind blowing for me. I wanted a bit more of an umami flavor in the meat, or an extra punch in the seasonings and salsa, I just didn't get that explosion of flavor that I usually get with Mexican food.

Problem is in the kitchen...\nCocktails are good.\nOverall a good experience but too expensive for what you actually eat.\n4 tacos, 4 cocktails = 90 euro"",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-06-20T08:00:08"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOPhzAuAzJeHOliOQVonVfiox8_Ga9DAVr0ePpz=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOFARc27yOrz5IwEc0u2yaXfWMQc_tGX3lz-ToE=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMFLGUaj-a8MxXB8XT4A18VJSynwvHBdF7lkCIo=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNQeeQEI-GfTtfdIvH0iyxdv04CpX1XZla4x0QN=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPzkmqJrkCYdAu_rqDkHTEgVlC22rPJFIpcPeCT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNU12McQlYQQRv5RB2NsH_-VYqyoDw6LFLQl5nN=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMMDRLR2lnRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Amber S"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101275405795097691009?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Great place for drinks and a bite to eat with friends.

This cozy spot offers an authentic Mexican dining experience with a menu that's small but packed with flavor. Each taco feels like a trip to a different part of Mexico, featuring fresh ingredients and delicious homemade sauces that make every bite special. The Beef Birria and Cochinita Pibil are personal favorites--tender, perfectly seasoned, and incredibly satisfying. The option to add fresh onions, coriander, and lime for free gives it that extra touch of authenticity.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, with a small seating area that feels intimate yet vibrant. You can tell that quality is a priority here, as they focus on dine-in rather than delivery, ensuring that each dish is served fresh and hot. The staff are warm and knowledgeable, happy to answer questions or recommend a dish if you're unsure what to try.\n\nIf you're looking for real Mexican food in Amsterdam, Taco Lindo is the place to go!

They were insulted we didn't want to take left overs home. Had to ask for the chips and salsa. Salsa mediocre\nAsked for the check came out quickly, imagine that!!! Then another woman came out and grabbed the  check and CC abruptly turned out to be the owner and never said anything to us, apologize or nothing.

It was excellent. The mezcal was delicious and it was really interesting how different the different types tasted and paired with the food.\n\nSpeaking of the food this was as excellent as last time. Again we particularly enjoyed the tuna tostada with generous slices of very tasty tuna and the bbq dorade which was sizeable enough to make us need a few more tortilla s. I also really enjoyed the pumpkin quesadilla which we did not try before.\n\nSo in spite of the storm outside we had a fantastic dinner. We hope something similar will be organized soon and under better weather circumstances so more people can enjoy it!\n\nDinner was excellent. We are big fans of the original masmais so were very excited about visiting this fish focused sister restaurant. It did not dissapoint. As it s still the soft opening they work with a set menu so you can try a lot of the dishes. All of them were delicious. Bbqed dorade and tuna tostada s were stand outs.\n\nIn addition to the food the drinks and service are also great. We enjoyed the smokey paloma the most. Staff was attentive and (unneccessarily) apologized when one course took slightly longer.\n\nThe restaurant also looks really nice. The decor is warm and neat. Bar seats looked great as well. I couldnt figure out if these seats can be booked specifically (like at the sister restaurant) but we d definitely go for them if that was an option.\n\nAll in all highly recommend a visit.

The food was simply amazing, and it was clear that the chef had a great deal of expertise in Mexican cuisine. From the flavorful burritos to the crispy tacos, every dish was perfectly prepared and bursting with flavor.\n\nWhat really impressed me was the chef's attention to detail. The food was beautifully presented and it was clear that only the freshest and highest quality ingredients were used. The result was truly exceptional.\n\nThe owners of the restaurant were equally impressive. They were incredibly welcoming and friendly, and their passion for Mexican cuisine was evident in every aspect of our dining experience. Their warm hospitality made us feel right at home and added to the overall enjoyment of the evening.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend \""Burrito\"" to anyone looking for an authentic and delicious Mexican dining experience in Amsterdam.

a 10 mins tram ride away from Amsterdam Central, The restaurant is at a good location with lot of other restaurants around it as well. As we entered the restaurant we really liked the vibes. Songs with cool beats in the background, nice friendly ambiance, perfect for the evenings for sure. In drinks we ordered Mexican beer Dos Equis and Margarita Miss Picantona. From the bites we ordered Jalapeno poppers and Totopos. The bites were really yummy and we enjoyed them with the drinks. We then ordered Tacos (chicken and veg), it was also really nice in taste. For the next round of drinks we ordered Michelada Special (beer + tequila)  and it was really great as well. The staff at the restaurant is very friendly and always happy to help with the menu. Overall a good experience and worth going in the evenings. Good to have reservation as it can get busy.\n\nPS: Although, must add that we found the place a relatively pricey as compared to other restaurants. The food is quite overpriced."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-06-30T07:36:18"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN0btJAO2_eDsnrzvUaU-xrJ7mP2JvHEWo3nD6u=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPWNoEzYJHiRfrxHiycqdcNcxhRVvY8fJVDk7I_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOChBVyydwssMAZGJInoc1QFKHb_3TwfTHKAAea=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNDv9jaavA2Iac0ygTh4jcXM7gP25dqCP5KG99_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP-MWavCKPl1IoUAJt_Q-2tLe85tjwysRexOoDQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNx46f-3ejoZ_8FRHfRi2j7Xtir_-EPlcmKmbEk=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPK-KwDLZaq3mFQrQ5QHOTHNASZEfUx8C9kZOhy=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzeWFXVmh3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Anna Tulkis"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113033021691749413262?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Great restaurant!

You walk in through a narrow corridor, past a small bar and into the main area of the restaurant which has a modern 1920s vibe with satin lounges, as well as tables.

Empty plates were removed almost instantly and we could order quickly aswell. The food was DELICIOUS! All veggie and vegan and the concept allows to share. We had the mushroom tacos which were super tasty, the cauliflower wings (also great) and (the cherry on top) roasted Yacon with mole sauce. The Yacon really surprised me! The mix of the rather crisp and sweet tasting root mixed with the roasted aroma and the mole was perfect! Never had this before and I was definitely impressed!!\nThey also have their own Madre blond (in collaboration with Homeland Brewery) which tastes exotic and fresh and complements the dishes very well.\nWe spent 60EU in total and were saturated and satisfied.

Delicious modern Mexican food to enjoy by yourself or with friends/loved ones, nice drinks, good vibes, friendly and amazing personnel! I do recommend to make a reservation online just in case, just to make sure that you have a table reserved.\n\nTo start of I had the TACOS DE CAMARONES (2) with shrimp, chipotle crema topped with red cabbage and samphire. It was an flavour bomb!\nSo good! The balance of flavours was spot on!\n\nAfter that I had the SERE DE PESCADO\nPan, a fried corvina in a red coconut sauce.\nA Caribbean Mexican dish from the Garifuna community. It was soooo good!\nThe fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce just elevated the entire dish! The freshly baked bread that they also serve with the dish is great to scoop up all that tasty goodness off the plate.\n\nFor my 3rd meal I had the TACOS DE SUADERO (4), a Mexico City classic. Crispy fried beef brisket with a tomatillo salsa. It was tasty, and good hit of salt... although a bit oily (but that's just my personal opinion). The lime definitely helped to add some acidity to counter the saltiness and oily flavour.\n\nTo finish it off I had the caramel flan for dessert with a cappuccino + almond syrup on the side.\nA nice and sweet way to finish off the food experience!\n\nWould I recommend this place and come back in the future?

The guacamole was the best I've ever had, and the tacos were out of this world. Each dish was beautifully presented and made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The margaritas were also a highlight, perfectly balanced and refreshing.\n\nService was impeccable, with attentive and knowledgeable staff who were eager to make our experience memorable. The prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and service. Max is very helpful, polite, and professional.\n\nOverall, this Mexican restaurant exceeded all my expectations.

relation to birria. I even drank the birria after dipping my quesadillas in it. And try their tacos please because they are insanely good, I ate like 8 of them. And definitely do yourself a favor and order a couple of their drinks. The spicy margarita, Paloma and the Michelada was literally insane. Michelada is this tomatoey beer cocktail and it's like Bloody Mary and Beer had a baby and produced this drink. It's insane! And on weekends they do this insane Taco Tuesday deal where tacos are EU3 each. Like I can eat 4 and just pay EU12 instead of being ripped off?

A limited no thrills menu that focuses on flavor and affordability that serves corn tortillas. You cant even buy corn tortillas in the grocery stores in the Netherlands, so you know its fresh made here.\nWith the weekend specials being priced at 3euros per taco, this is the most affordable taco in Amsterdam, yet some of the best around. The only downside is that there is no mixing and matching tacos so you end up ordering a lot to try it all, or just come back another time if you dont want to stuff yourself.\nIf you want help deciding what to order, then pork carnitas are a good option, the veggie ones were great, but a bit saucy. I find in general, birria is a bit of an overhyped taco but I will say its good here. The chips and guacamole were Excellent and stood out.\nA true mexican drink that not all taquerias have but is available here is the Horchata.

From Mexico to Amsterdam
How it all came to be...

It all started in 2001 when Los Pilones opened the doors at Kerkstraat 63 and introduced authentic Mexican cuisine in The Netherlands!

Los Pilones is a Mexican cantina style concept, serving fresh home made food and drinks in a colourful and vibrant atmosphere - a fiesta straight from Mexico to Amsterdam. You can drop in for tacos, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, fresh margaritas, micheladas, over 200 different kinds of 100% agave tequilas and mezcal.

Pilon in Mexico means ""a little extra"" and that is exactly what we intend to give you when you visit Los Pilones!",,1742,4.3,"[{""name"":""Tacos &

I agree the Nachos could use more cheese sauce but that's because it's really good and would be amazing if there was a lot more on there. We were slightly disappointed in the Margarita jug, when it came out it was not more than one and a quarter glass each (we did not complain so this is on us, just a heads up, would be better to serve a bigger jug for that price).

We were lucky to be there for taco Tuesday so we managed to try multiple tacos for decent price. I would definitely recommend to go for tacos and quesadillas. Cocktails were very good too.

They also have their famous Taco Tuesday's same as in the US, when they make 2 extra taco's at a cheaper price than usual. Also they have a monthly taco that they change from time to time. The interior is very colorful and playfull. On the back of the bar there is a wide selection of different types of liquor.

We were sitting from 7-10pm and you are annoyed by cleaning stuff around you and smell of the market. Sitting inside it's better option but super small place. Average cocktail is 10-15 eur, that's typical Dutch price. They have frozen Margaritas 1 L, wondering who is ordering this since after 5 mins when is melted it's not drinkable.

On one hand, the food and drinks were delicious. We opted for the taco Tuesday deal which was EU22 for one cocktail and two tacos. The cocktail was of high-quality and the tacos were very tasty. However, there were a few things which made this experience far from five stars. The price is quite high, I understand Amsterdam is quite expensive but even for Amsterdam I felt like the price was quite a lot. The food was good but the portions were quite small considering we spent almost EU50 on four tiny tacos. The interior design is very beautiful and cozy, however, we were seated against the wall  in what seemed like a waiting room with a tiny side table against the wall. When we arrived we were initially asked if we had a reservation and we said no, so we were told our choice was to sit at the bar or sit at the small tables. This is completely understandable as I understand places like this can be very busy so we were happy to sit at the small tables as we assumed it's very busy with lots of reservations. However, as time passed, we noticed that almost all of the tables and booths were empty with no one sitting in them so we wondered why we were told to sit in these uncomfortable small tables when there was an abundance of tables free. I assumed many people might not have turned up for their reservations but it felt a bit strange. A part of me wondered if it was because we weren't Dutch as there was a slight cold feel from the waiters that I couldn't shake off which really dampened the experience."",""published_at"":""6 days ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-07T18:07:08"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Ellie, \nThank you for sharing your experience at Restaurant Fiona. \nWe're sorry to hear that you felt the price-quality ratio didn't meet your expectations.

to be fairly standard - nothing particularly noteworthy, but comfortable enough for a casual dining experience.\n\nThe highlight here is unquestionably the food, which stands a notch above the ordinary. We started with the Nachos Sonora, which, while bursting with flavor, fell short in portion size, especially as a dish advertised for two. The toppings, too, were on the scantier side, which was a bit of a letdown.\n\nMoving on to the main course, the Combinacion Alfonso's was a mixed bag. The taco was average, failing to make much of an impression. However, the enchilada and burrito were a different story altogether - absolutely divine. These dishes alone make the restaurant worth visiting, elevating the overall culinary experience.\n\nSo, while it doesn't quite hit the five-star mark for me, it's definitely a solid choice for good food. I'll surely be back, and I'd recommend giving it a try if you're in the mood for some tasty Mexican cuisine with a few standout dishes."",""published_at"":""11 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-01-17T14:05:56"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you very much for the visit and kind words.

We're glad you found our place appealing from the outside, but we're sorry to hear that your experience with the arepas and patacones did not meet your expectations.\n\nWhen we processed your payment, we personally asked for your feedback and explained what had happened. It really helps us ensure you leave happy if you inform us right on the spot about any issues; we're always more than happy to make things right.\n\nWe have informed our kitchen about the size of the arepa, as they are typically larger, especially since they are meant to be bite-sized under our bites section on the menu. Thank you for your feedback; we will make sure the size of the arepa is always consistent moving forward. Unfortunately, you received a smaller size, but we could have addressed this immediately if you had let us know.\n\nRegarding the patacones, there was a mistake with the type of plantain used; we mistakenly used the slightly yellow plantain instead of the green one. We understand this mistake and will ensure accuracy moving forward.\n\nWe truly value your feedback and hope you'll consider giving us another chance to provide you with a better experience in the future.

We started off sitting downstairs until a table opened up upstairs.  The employees were really nice in accomodating us which was great.  Then we started off buying a pitcher of Mango margarita. Really tasty margarita.  We also started off with some nachos. It was interesting to see cucumber on nachos but the nachos taste was alright. For the main course we ordered: a chimichanga (deep fried flour tortilla filled with beef, also came with rice, beans and salad), a burrito (chicken and beef, came with rice, beans and salad), Fajita Margarita and Vegetarian Chimichanga. The meat for the Fajitas were very flavorful. The Chimichangas were solid but the size was a bit on the smaller side.

The quesadilla with beef stew was super flavorful, and I couldn't get enough of the rich, cheesy filling paired with the consome.

The wait staff are all very friendly and especially helpful on recommendations. This place is about Nachos and I love that they make their own corn (no gluten, added bonus for me) tortilla chips. From the first bite of my tasty Erasmus nachos to the last I was in heaven. The cocktails were the icing on top. I can't say enough good things about this place...

I have been looking for a restaurant that combined artisan cocktails, creative and tasteful dishes and fine-dining experience in a laid-back way. This is definitely @larette_amsterdam  I have fallen for each piece I have eaten here; starting with the fantastic sourdough bread, then the harmoniously crafted entries and the incredible short rib along with the leek and aubergine that could compete with the main. Let's say AMEN for the man behind the bar who has created and prepared amazing set of cocktails. I am really amazed by the drinks menu, especially because the cocktails section is incredibly wide, from most-loved traditionals to signature house blends. It captures your heart the minute you see the location, just by a canal and sitting by the window, you can't help but feel romantic. The interior is gorgeously decorated and branded with great attention to details but it is so subtle that it doesn't bother you, instead it is artistic. The food is also influenced by this artistic spririt. From the tableware to cutlery, from drinks to food garnishing, everything is on point. The service is incredible, handsome people attending to your dining experience with great care, what more can I ask for?

The food was excellent, I had the vegan steak, which I could tell wasn't real meat but still great. The jue was fantastic with the brown bread. I would recommend those who can't eat meat.\n\n2. The customer service was fantastic, catered to or needs, and they were very polite and friendly.\n\n3. Toilets are very important and I was very impressed by how clean and tidy they were. Not to mention, the cubicles smelt great (lol).\n\n4.

If you are a foodie like myself it's definitely worth the try  So so so many delicious dishes , they are all priced similar. We tried the bitterballen with beef and the sauce they have for it ans it was 10/10. So crispy and delicious. We tried a hot dog with cheese , bacon and sausage , the hotdog had a pretzel bread which was super nice and it was over all tasty too. The edamame beans from a different stand were very good too , I didn't get to try the scallion pancakes as there was a long queue , i really wanted but i would definitely love to try it next time. Would recommend coming here around 12:20 as it opened at 12 for us and it wasn't as busy at that time but then got very busy. The atmosphere is great , everyone is enjoying the food and music.

Let me break down my thoughts for you.\n\nFirst up, I tried the Mexico City dish, which consists of eggs served over a tortilla. Honestly, it was just okay. I appreciate the attempt to bring a taste of Mexico to the menu, but it felt a bit underwhelming. If you're aiming for a true Mexican breakfast vibe, I'd suggest they switch it up and serve the over easy eggs over red chilaquiles instead. Chilaquiles are essentially tortilla chips smothered in salsa and topped with eggs, cheese, and sometimes chicken or beans. Trust me, everyone would love it. The Mexico City dish has some of the right elements, but it's not quite there yet.\n\nNow, let's talk about the French toast. Oh. My. God. It was made with brioche, and it was absolutely amazing. The brioche gave it this wonderfully soft and fluffy texture that just soaked up all the syrup and butter perfectly. It was sweet, decadent, and exactly what you want from a French toast. I would come back just for this dish alone.\n\nThe coffee was also top-notch. Sometimes, brunch places can slack off on the coffee, but not here. It was rich, flavorful, and just the pick-me-up I needed. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or just need your morning caffeine fix, you won't be disappointed.\n\nA big shoutout to the staff as well. They were kind, smiley, and really made the experience enjoyable. Good service can make all the difference, and the team at The Breakfast Club definitely knows how to treat their customers right.\n\nAll in all, I'd say \""The Breakfast Club\"" is definitely worth a visit. They've got some fantastic dishes on the menu and a great atmosphere. Even though the Mexico City dish needs some tweaking, the French toast and coffee more than make up for it. Plus, with such a friendly staff, you're guaranteed a pleasant time. I'll definitely be coming back to try more of their offerings. If you're looking for a new brunch spot, give The Breakfast Club a shot!"",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-05T15:22:07"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Ismael!

The woman highly recommended eating at iBoenda as she said the food was the best Indonesian restaurant in the Netherlands in her opinion. Well, this woman was not wrong. It is little paradise in my opinion! You will never get an authentic, traditional and fantastic home cooked cuisine anywhere in the world as good as this restaurant! I've eaten in Indonesia too...I'm not exaggerating. They also do take aways and an equivalent to 'Just Eat'. I ate in the restaurant twice it was that good. I just wanted to try a little bit of everything. It's like a buffet style counter where you can choose whatever you like, honestly it's amazing and the restaurant is clean. I am only in Amsterdam for a few days but I guarantee, I will be visiting iBoenda a second and hopefully a third time again before I leave. I hope my mum won't ever get to read this as she doesn't use the internet, but as much as I love her Indonesian cooking, this Indonesian restaurant is far better and that is saying something, because I love my mum's cooking. If you miss Indonesian food, or whether you have never tried it, I absolutely recommend you eat in and get a take away too as you will not be disappointed with the food and price. Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Thank you to the lady on the train that recommended this restaurant/take away. I will make sure when I next visit Amsterdam, one of the first places to come will be iBoenda.

I feel that any low reviews might stem from not understanding the menu as to what Tomatillo offers. I will touch on that.\n\nThey do have alcoholic drinks (some reviews from years ago mentioned they did not - this has changed). I had white wine, and my wife had a margarita. She kept raving about how good it was and how she enjoyed its tartness.\n\nOur food was excellent. I had a fajita burrito which means it comes with more vegetables than just beans, rice, salsa, and cheese. My wife ordered just the burrito with pico de gallo and raved about it. I added habanero sauce on the side with mine and had it in a bowl. It came with two corn tortillas to make my own tacos with it. It was super good.\n\nLike any restaurant, one might have to figure out the offering and details that match one's taste preferences. My case in point is this: their carryout to people who have figured it out is robust. Don't miss this gem. It is really good. Dine in and let them explain the offerings.

However, I have been two times in Oaxaca restaurant and it has not disappointed. Mostly if you think the great lengths they went into transforming this corner into a feel like a restaurant in Oaxaca city experience, they even brought the artisan crafts from there. If you opt for eat in the \""terrace\"" you have more of an urban taste of Mexico with guacamole, tacos and other bites that honestly taste just like home. If you go inside to the main restaurant even though prices are high you will get the real taste of traditional mexican food which is nonetheless to be made with extreme craft and long hours. Do not get confused that you will find here what other countries have made you believe about mexican food, this is the real thing."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-14T22:09:37"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM1EIQQVJpaAX0pZ1lJLJkspoA5L907VAa2V7Ww=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM8zAY2qHrWiI7Wlhby416t1Sk-lNFJp_smWBJj=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMfP00yDxOYZr1R9Z27nZP_aWraPchn4jKTQLIz=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipObYZZvqzBwYMlbXwjF362_vWmelWL-MuyH6ySG=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPBrsM_XN2MvU7kerYqMrYZddpj_bJor2K6pi69=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOojdtRRoBN5fMfoNoj00UvrJT4hiWlRwDX1OWy=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPJs1CuNYKGYR1j4RUqnClCKW0P47Sw8XgjXzPh=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPMcAaxYHF6Tk9IdQn1DomaQDScFz_lPzTr5Tw0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPrhk0D-56YT94vFNn94KDjRDHosTFODx_BagQu=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMUD5wE7qjaLhuH8o3EFG0a8Roo9QQXalMZMkYa=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPoKtdJ5-B77GnLU3tcvAi48FyQXCnL14aBINb-=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOkdBN9Z9bo4VLaOjpGWdKpzFJGeV7-2mv45Y1V=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMaGFLV1dnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Colleen Boland"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110574847663483511212?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""On the one hand, the service is excellent, with the staff going above and beyond and remaining perfect professionals.

Two weeks ago, I had a margarita, a dark-n-stormy, and a bloody mary on the terrace, and the drinks were fantastic as usual. However, my experience took a downturn when it came to paying the bill. Due to the busy evening, the waitress took a while to bring the check, and in my hurry, I paid without closely checking the amount on the mobile payment terminal. The next morning, I realized I had been charged EU52.58 instead of the expected EU34.50, overpaying by EU18.08. When I returned the next day to resolve the issue, I was met with unhelpfulness and rudeness. The lady who attended to me (Maria) was argumentative and unwilling to listen. Despite having the exact timestamp from my bank card, she refused to check the cash register and did not offer any apology or attempt to understand my concern. I wrote an email, waited over a week, and received no reply. The lack of customer service and unwillingness to address a clear overcharge left me very disappointed. While I understand mistakes happen, the handling of this issue was entirely unsatisfactory. I think I lost my favorite spot and will not return. Hence, I am now sharing this review."",""published_at"":""7 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-05-27T13:58:40"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Beste Jesabado,\n\nHet spijt ons ten zeerste dat u een slechte ervaring met ons heeft gehad.

gem, offering an unforgettable dining experience that perfectly blends exceptional food, warm hospitality, and a cozy ambiance. My visit to this restaurant was nothing short of delightful, and I left thoroughly impressed.\n\nThe menu is a celebration of Persian cuisine, with a wide variety of dishes that are both authentic and flavorful. Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with rich, aromatic flavors that showcased the skill and dedication of the chefs. The kebabs were grilled to perfection, tender and juicy, while the saffron-infused rice was a highlight, adding a fragrant and colorful touch to the meal.\n\nWhat truly stood out to me was the quality of the ingredients. Everything tasted fresh, and it was evident that great care had gone into selecting and preparing each component. The portions were generous, offering excellent value for money.\n\nThe atmosphere at Manoto was another highlight. The restaurant exudes a welcoming charm, with tasteful decor that reflects the Persian heritage while maintaining a modern and inviting vibe. Whether you're visiting for a romantic dinner or a meal with friends and family, the setting is perfect.\n\nThe staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, offering helpful recommendations and ensuring that every aspect of our dining experience was enjoyable. Their genuine warmth added a personal touch that made the visit even more memorable.\n\nManoto also offers a well-curated drinks menu, with both traditional Persian beverages and a selection of wines and cocktails to complement the meal. The saffron tea, in particular, was a perfect way to round off the evening.\n\nIn conclusion, Manoto Restaurant is a must-visit for anyone in Amsterdam looking to explore Persian cuisine or simply enjoy a high-quality dining experience. The combination of delicious food, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a standout choice. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-03-26T20:07:06"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMq81AG8ZsyLPfLaA1JDn_tg91RlQKY8Ug_5APE=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM5fWa8AQam3vxJZdf5mtkXLZsWHHITU2_tGVXh=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO4r_s2tT-9_q40HfPVPCO7kS4v1d4YoTo_M1IK=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPND5ncPfdXpQBvwt7hHtt1n1A8uwiCo1zt8OSS=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNKIMGU89XZPF_vasFPNVFnaNC8lXfQaMGDs3_J=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPHjISIafXJya79r8CJmAqeU5ltzy4bkk1z7fwp=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPCk-mOVUV3LMKV5BAZnuIoj7rE6SL0cAf5eBcx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPB0-f0E1gweQdKwqq9DaU5yN9KyDEnhpfs1xp0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNoKPHB8sin9jRZyB9xmwIziXxuqmrNqerAE6J5=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMiOArsgDaRdVxgwLKyXGDbuesnddfAxPFkONMx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMaWgnuFo00IQzvUTKlWnkKmPlmMHA48EBr-O3c=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNSU9-seNiyipcQ9v2UsvjZGLjMoV6PqPwnXXTx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMweuzXpmwFyJayqcvJ_hLHKMNvguAFrrC4emfl=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP2eXGSdZD8nrlZzIiJDEf3VepiCCVv1eZCN3dT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP9VohB2R1fSAlso1imhwp9Jf_WfSFBzygIyHfc=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNx43LrGXsASxe71SQco62JUQs85fu3mg8r9jF_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMi-4HPTM1n_Te0QOHRbR0iBzo7SL9RJDt99Qfw=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMaFPOqU4pr20lAR2PPjHOXHulQvme4-ka-E5on=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOwkN8PcqfAy1Fj5pW93A3OPWuNWgLrtvMW6NQ6=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMTnZCHdj_W78wSo2RtesXdmTWK64RUUPRMduVx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN_X6ifpDkJ8Wcn9E6-L04jcwViIHquwy90x-b7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMvv-uhSSLczw-pTzYm_BZl_oMTelPO8j0BvLYY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPRN0CAFAF8toQ34X_cI9MppyX_Hs197liWb3v7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOlQ37Lkf4ACj4YerYFa4lq6P3HmcNQ7r8NqUlv=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN9l0WFfivFpz3p5ILXeIce4Tx_S73Pfd_aXJnP=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO4mU8vVYQMZIaqvakqT3-1TR6bz_jQxe4mio_I=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYX1pPclRREAE"",""rating"":3,""name"":""Lana Sweidan"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117045091796057687586?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""I recently dined at Manoto, and  found the food to be delicious--each dish was flavorful and well-prepared.

The service is nice but the place inside is so tiny and can seat maybe 8 people so you need to grab your food and leave. By the time you have reached home or another place to sit to eat the fries are cold and inedible and the bao buns stuck to the paper. Two of them with fries is not a filling meal at all even though you pay more than 20EU for it. The taste was good but for sure not worth what you're paying for.

I think in a scheme of increasing g profit they opted for a cheap wheat noodle that is thick and filling but lacks taste and texture. I'd give the noodles a -4 that's how bad they are.

Unfortunately, the experience didn't meet our expectations, starting with the service.\n\nWhen I requested my steak to be cooked medium, there seemed to be some miscommunication. Although the doneness levels were explained on the menu, it took a while for the waitress to understand, and I had to point it out. This interaction felt a bit awkward, and I suspect there might have been a language barrier.\n\nAs for the food, it was disappointing. My steak, which I ordered medium, arrived well-done and lacked flavor. My partner and I had specifically chosen this restaurant hoping for a higher-quality dining experience, but we regretted not opting for a more reliable option.\n\nThe wine selection added to the frustration. We initially chose a wine made from three different grape varieties listed on the menu. However, it wasn't available, and the suggested alternative was described as \""similar.\"" When we asked about the grape varieties in the new option, we couldn't get a clear answer. Upon checking the label ourselves, we realized it was a completely different wine with only two grapes. This lack of attention to detail was disappointing.\n\nOverall, the experience fell short in both service and food quality.

While it was a good dinner, I wasn't too obsessed with the flavor of the bowl, maybe it could have used a unifying sauce/dressing to make it feel like an actual salad. I appreciated the big menu and lots of both vegetarian and vegan options.

The concept of Burgerfabriek is a combination of old essence in a contemporary suit.

We come back to basics: fresh, fast, flavourful food pimped with a modern twist. An industrial and rough, but cushy space; and a kitchen based on organic, primary, quality ingredients, with a touch of sophistication

Burgerfabriek features also comfortable tables where you can tap your own beer.
