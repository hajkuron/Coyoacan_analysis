have been to Hannah's twice, the first time being maybe a year ago, and the second time being now.\n\nThe first time was a pleasant experience, but unfortunately, they have really gone down in quality. It was very busy, and there was only one waitress, who clearly had too much on her plate. She was very sweet and helpful, but unable to manage the whole floor by herself.\n\nWe ordered an omelette on sourdough and grilled vegetables and a focaccia with cheese, artichoke, and a chestnut-mushroom mix.\n\nIt took an hour and 15 minutes from the moment we came in until our food came. The omelette was nice, but the grilled vegetables were mushy and the toast was burnt. The focaccia had whole artichokes on it which was a bit much, and the chestnut-mushroom mixture was just straight up missing.\n\nFor what you get, it is also just too expensive now. The previous time (same prices but higher quality) it was worth the price.\n\nThey are nice people so I do not have the heart to give 2 stars even though my experience was certainly not worth more than that. But I really hope they bounce back. If so, I will revisit and change my review."",""published_at"":""3 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-21T15:20:16"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyajZPRHlnRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Alexandre Darbellay"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108971799117100391129?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Absolutely lovely place in the west of Amsterdam.

Despite booking well in advance, we waited around 1.5 hours after ordering before our food arrived. Our group of four had a shakshuka, an omelet, and two brunch menus with water, but the dishes were quite bland--even after adding salt--and didn't meet our expectations. We noticed other guests sending food back, though we didn't have the time to wait longer.

We were very big fans of the previous restaurant at this location, Cafe Zurich, so we decided to give the new owners a try. We were not disappointed!  The special Christmas Eve menu was a great way for us to get an overall picture of the food and service.  All of it was plentiful and delicious.  We especially loved the antipasti (calamari was a huge hit, even with our 5 year-old) and the truffle linguini was the most delicious pasta my mom and I have ever had!  My kids loved the pizza, and we are so thrilled now to have an authentic pizza place closer to our house.  On top of it, the atmosphere was fantastic.  They've repainted and decorated the place to reflect a fun, old-school Italian atmosphere, with Ferrari toy cars nestled in the brick-work by the open kitchen and the green and red stripes on the ceiling. The service was very friendly, attentive and a definite improvement on Cafe Zurich.  We really look forward to coming back to this family-style place again!"",""published_at"":""2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-25T09:21:12"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you, Lora.

We really like the chill vibe at the terrace outside during the summer but it's just next to the road so sometimes it can be noisy. It can become very cozy inside the restaurant on a chill night as well.\n\nWe always satisfy with the dish we ordered. They always serve fresh ingredients and they cook our beef perfectly as what we ordered. My husband really likes their lasagna.\n\nThey have quite limited menus so we can't go there too often as it's gonna almost the same dish everytime we go.

We ordered the bok choy salad, mushroom risotto, and veal cheeks. Although we joined the dining quite late, and only one chef was actively working--leaving us with a considerable wait--every dish was worth it, exceeding our expectations and leaving us wanting more.\n\nThe bok choy salad was refreshing, with a truly unique flavor profile brought together by the crispy chips and the crunch of the bok choy. The mushroom risotto was creamy, bursting with flavor, and perfectly executed with a delicate texture that made it nearly impossible not to take another bite. The veal cheeks were outstanding, with incredible texture and flavor, though the potato on the side felt slightly confusing.\n\nWe spoke to the server about the chef and learned that he is Italian, drawing inspiration from American and other European cuisines.\n\nWhile the service was slow due to the single chef in the kitchen, we didn't mind, as the quality of the food made up for the wait. We had hoped to enjoy another meal at the restaurant on our last night at the hotel, but unfortunately, it closed early."",""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-03T13:18:29"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Mackenzie, \nThank you so much for leaving such a great review!\nWe are really happy to see that you enjoyed your stay and food from our restaurant. \nOf course, we are sorry to hear, that you waited long time to get your food, but thank you for all the compliments.

The woman who waited on us (Lydia?) was lovely, very friendly and helpful with our order. They have good coffee, offered mimosas and other beverages, and a great selection of Dutch pancakes. We had one pancake with apples and bacon, managing perfectly our request to go easy on the cheese. My pancake was ham and caramelized onions with the standard amount of cheese on top. Let me tell you... they were both FABULOUS!! Much thinner than other pancakes we've had in Amsterdam, more like a crepe than a pancake, and the pancakes were executed perfectly with the right amount of ingredients in each. Both combinations were incredible and a little syrup on the one with apples & bacon had our eyes rolling back in our heads (I'm salivating writing this review)!

Definitely a spot I'd recommend to anyone looking to try classic Dutch pancakes in a cozy setting!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-07T11:02:09"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPSakoidUKqGpkT9u-KjvpOtoXA5FYWdmi6EHHO=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNV1N8DhMEJ4nItJcU7719Yr7WS30CXOJufNtjt=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO0FBoXxswkz0zr6rUfWjFCRrQnGMQoXKpDXNGJ=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQbThfVnFRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""caroline gordon"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118239584245010284647?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""It was raining today and we were lucky to get a table.

Food even humble food should be attractive on the plate. At your prices it is reasonable to expect a little more thought about the appearance of a dish.\nVessel is local for us and we have had very pleasant brunches here in the summer so it is disappointing that, on last nights experience,\nwe cannot rely on it for ourselves or recommend it to visitors.\nThe staff were very pleasant and helpful and we did, very gently, give them our thoughts when asked. The gesture of a free dessert was well-meant but cost wasn't really the issue.

I ordered around 30 euros at 2PM to try out, the taste of the sushi is good. Rice is not too sticky, just a mouthfeel and just the right amount of vinegar. The quality and price range matches well together but the tuna nigiri isnt always that fresh....\n\nThere is one thing.. it would be nice if you can get the same amount of avocado size in your sushi compatible with the cucumber.... so this would be the MINUS.\n\nThis place has just opened a few months ago in Amsterdam.

previously stayed at Westervilla in Dec '23 where we had an amazing time, we returned in Dec '24  along with 2 of our friends, with high expectations.||Sadly, our expectations were dashed soon after arriving.||As we checked in, we realised the restaurant (which previously was a chilled and intimate, but subsequently has had a rebrand since we last visited) was busy with very large (and loud) Christmas party groups. ||We weren't warned at all in advance of arriving, and when we questioned also found out there was to be music playing for the party too.||Less than impressed, we had no choice but to chance it and stay as it was too late to cancel and rebook something else. |On our first night of 3 (Friday night) we had extremely loud thumping music underneath us until 1am.|When we spoke to the staff, they couldn't have cared less and just offered ear plugs. Also, when we enquired about speaking to the manager we were told 'he's not here, just email'. No offer of any resolution or promise to get the manager to contact us.||The following day we enquired if we were to experience the same hellish noise as we had on the Friday night. ||We were assured that there were no full parties on the Saturday night, and that the music would stop by 11pm. We once again enquired about talking to the manager and were once again rebuffed with 'email'.||Sadly, our Saturday night experience was just as poor, although no parties as such, thumping music resonated through the floor of our room, well past the promised 11pm.|I went down at 11;25pm where I was told the music would stop in 5 minutes.|The music DID stop, but what DIDN'T stop was over an hour of scraping and banging furniture, shouting staff, slamming doors, all this after two nights of complaints about noise from 50% of their entire guests that weekend!||We once again emailed (having not had any response to our original emails so far)||On the Sunday, we finally had contact via phone from the Manager, Mario.||I'd like to credit him with trying to resolve the situation. We sat down at the restaurant below the rooms where our group of 5  (spread over 3 rooms) spoke to him. He understood our frustrations, and was frustrated at his staff's lack of compassion, driving us to email, and for not further raising our issued with him.||He said that he would like to offer us a free meal that night, and the owner, Christian would refund one night of our stay.||We explained that after two nights of completely disturbed sleep, that we were fully expecting two nights to be refunded. |Mario said he would go back to the owner and make our case, and agreed it was a reasonable request.|We did enjoy a complimentary meal we were offered on the Sunday night, but of course that really isn't a huge cost to the hotel/restaurant at cost price.||Sadly, on our last day after we had checked out, Mario called to say Christian, the owner would not budge on our request for a refund on the two nights.||We explained our disappointment but of course had no choice but to accept the refund of one night, we did explain that when asked to review the hotel, we could only be fully honest about our experience, and lack of satisfactory resolution.||It is such a shame that after an amazing experience 12 months before, that we would now never return to Westervilla. The staff (other than Mario) really couldn't have cared less about our discomfort, and the owner didn't care enough to offer us the compensation we clearly should have been offered.||I have never ever written this before, but I would advise people to avoid staying there as a hotel guest.||We are back in Amsterdam in July for a concert, and Westervilla should have been our natural choice, we will now take our custom to a hotel where our custom is fully valued."",""published_at"":""3 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-22T23:59:59"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYMHVMa2ZnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Ellie Lancaster"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106282298519911563733?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Stayed at the Westervilla Hotel for 2 nights with my partner, and had an amazing time.

While the base of the cheesecake was really good, the orange topping was overwhelmingly bitter. Next time, I'll try a different flavor.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1.\tWaiting List and Time Limit: The place is small and has limited seating. It was chaotic trying to find a spot to sit and eat, especially with some people staying at tables without ordering. A waiting list system and a time limit for tables could help manage this better.\n2.\tAdd a Cooker Hood: The smell from the cooking was noticeable throughout the space. Installing a range hood would help with ventilation and improve the dining experience.\n3.\tStaff Training and Process Optimization: The staff could use better training, and the service processes could be more organized to improve efficiency and customer experience.\n4.\tInstall a Door Closer: The door was often left open, and with freezing temperatures outside, this made things uncomfortable. A door closer would solve this problem."",""published_at"":""4 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-14T15:30:42"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNAjPZSQY_qHZaOeae1S0baLk4YDOaRRg9HNfZp=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURud1pmRHdRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Aga Pitka"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113865648516863732474?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Kazik is an absolutely charming place with an amazing atmosphere.

The sourdough bread paired with French butter and horseradish was a perfect complement.\n\nFor my main, I had the special: beef cheek served with a lovely gravy, creamy mashed potatoes, and perfectly grilled baby carrots. So comforting. To top it all off, the rice pudding for dessert blew my friend away, it was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal.\n\nOverall, this was a 10/10 experience for us!

The location and ambience was nice/cozy romantic. We did a special festive tasting menu which started really strong - unfortunately it didn't stay strong but I would still say the food was pretty good and worth checking out, especially for the value of price. Also they had a good selection of wines!\n\nCons: I give it a 4 stars bc the service was painfullyyyy slow, esp considering it was a set menu for everyone. Res was at 20:30 for a 5 course meal and didn't leave until 23:30 and that was after asking them to start bring plates quickly.

The restaurant was full, and despite an issue with our booking, they managed to find space and set up a table for two.\nThe food was excellent. We started with the burrata and the Jerusalem artichoke, followed by the aubergine and the cod with broccolini. We finished with the pear. Everything was delicious, but a special mention goes to the sauces--the one paired with the burrata was particularly outstanding.\nHowever, during dinner, they decided to dim the lights almost completely. While the atmosphere was already subdued, this was a bit too much for our taste. Without the candle placed very close to us, it was hard to see what was on our plates. That was the only negative aspect.\nAside from that, the staff were incredibly friendly, and the dishes were excellent.

If it is a bit busy, it would difficult to talk with friends. Luckily i was there on Sunday evening and it was not as crowded.\n\nNow let's get to food. I loved the Burrata. Light but definitely packed with flavors. The burrata itself was exceptional, but melon was standard. Second menu i took was Mackerel. Sauce was good, fish was properly cooked! Personally think the fish can be improved. If there is a way to increase the freshness of it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAs for Cote de beouf, it was indeed good! For the price and also the quality, it was within expectations.\n\nThe main protagonist of the restaurant would be the collection of wine. They have various wine.

The egg white was raw and once I cut the poached egg the egg white leaked out all over my salad making croutons and crispy chicken soaking wet. We called for someone to take an order three times. Then the waitress helped us. She was nice and even tried to help us to get a bigger table. She was helpful and friendly. Unfortunately we did not ask for her name. But we found that the amount of staff working on Friday night is not enough as they physically couldn't take all orders and serve everyone quickly. We were a huge group but we all had problems with ordering. At some point we just went to the bar to get our drinks and there was only one bartender in full bar.

But service picked up as the place got busier.\nMy friend had the smoked salmon sandwich and I opted for the eggs. The salmon was lovely and fresh, and my eggs were poached to perfection and finished with yogurt and spices - absolutely delicious! Coffees were great and my friend also ordered some refreshing homemade passionfruit lemonade.\nDuring the day this is a superb place to chill out, have a meal or just meet for coffee.

The food was excellent and offered a delightful change from the typical hotel buffet or standard holiday breakfast.\n\nI opted for the Power Breakfast, which featured a delicious bagel accompanied by a small continental selection of cheese and sliced meat. This meal also included coffee and juice. My son thoroughly enjoyed his smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel, a favourite of his so it was clearly well executed.\n\nThe coffee was as good as you would hope in a place dedicated to beans as well as bagels! I had a cappuccino, which was perfectly served and presented. The flavour profile was rich and satisfying.\n\nThe staff were professional and friendly, offering great recommendations and engaging in pleasant conversation. Their attentiveness and warmth added to the overall positive experience.\n\nOverall, this cafe provided a memorable start to our day with its great food, lovely atmosphere, and excellent service.

We ordered 2 of the Gele Peter off of the menu which was orange juice with bitter lemon. It took longer than I anticipated for our drinks to arrive considering it was just an orange juice with bitter lemon and it wasn't that busy. The restaurant itself was nice, I wasn't a fan of the drink - I have had orange juice and bitter lemon elsewhere before and it has been much nicer. The food being brought out did look really nice - the bagels looked fresh and the ingredients / fillings also looked fresh. The staff were friendly but like I said previously the service was a bit slow considering we just had a drink. I would possibly go back again for food but I would hope the service was a lot quicker than having to wait 10 minutes again for a juice. Overall it was a nice place with friendly staff, a nice seating area outside which is nice in the good weather, I was however disappointed with the slow service and not the nicest drink."",""published_at"":""5 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2019-06-03T22:21:20"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOtIudU8RuG7IVDDKPMWL4IvUCzlQh4Jktfg_d7=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNCzdLv8mturpgkiYpINmxtyI6YAcsttkfp00_s=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMMl9eYbk_wkHIF9e7GdxCcbvKp_l5Dy1yaNPsG=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPJd9_ZInBmxUkQaAfxltGmBao1piSLW9FlDTMN=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOrUrBnJrHXJ33wCvxVXkToxT0vKTl6aC-G_5-J=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMPB1UmN-kn8M52EgYJT1xUb-04anRqRiRyffoX=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOPmENFRn1QZdPNCH8YHyQ3s4UBl30qy79EoCfp=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMACMeBxVhSsCjy-BS4GBchrKps9YzEnO9xig5w=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNeBDS3R9hloM7g8G_S3HR3Qt2Ft4zoIqNHiKKG=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN6_lXgdjNq5jv_8VvrQ1FIa746AP5WDiiShvMw=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP0dgLY-9ELPknaHszfGlClL3ljC9Xz4HvNlFoe=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNLIKW-NrsQLNU1gGQXC2984RaWEKgIaelsiQiU=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipODDf7b1AJc0Zrcp2dAp0IcJg54D7Zxt5tAWbRS=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOV3vgmiUJYsZ1nDkFh1vbL38ZkVMDrhTVXoGo_=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHLXZtcFZBEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Gary Hymes"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116496789587906828896?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Nice, friendly place.

The vegetables were perfectly boiled, adding a satisfying texture to the dish.\nNext, I sampled the Nasi Campur, a traditional Indonesian dish. This platter had an assortment of items including rendang and vegetables. The rendang, one of Indonesia's national dishes, was absolutely delicious. Its rich and complex flavors complemented the fried rice perfectly.\nOverall, Iboenda impressed me with its authentic flavors and high-quality ingredients.

The woman highly recommended eating at iBoenda as she said the food was the best Indonesian restaurant in the Netherlands in her opinion. Well, this woman was not wrong. It is little paradise in my opinion! You will never get an authentic, traditional and fantastic home cooked cuisine anywhere in the world as good as this restaurant! I've eaten in Indonesia too...I'm not exaggerating. They also do take aways and an equivalent to 'Just Eat'. I ate in the restaurant twice it was that good. I just wanted to try a little bit of everything. It's like a buffet style counter where you can choose whatever you like, honestly it's amazing and the restaurant is clean. I am only in Amsterdam for a few days but I guarantee, I will be visiting iBoenda a second and hopefully a third time again before I leave. I hope my mum won't ever get to read this as she doesn't use the internet, but as much as I love her Indonesian cooking, this Indonesian restaurant is far better and that is saying something, because I love my mum's cooking. If you miss Indonesian food, or whether you have never tried it, I absolutely recommend you eat in and get a take away too as you will not be disappointed with the food and price. Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Thank you to the lady on the train that recommended this restaurant/take away. I will make sure when I next visit Amsterdam, one of the first places to come will be iBoenda.

One of the people had previously said not to be too big on vegetarian food, yet even he was persuaded that this is a great place \""despite\"" being all vegetarian.\n\nThe dishes arrived with perfect timing and while waiting we could enjoy the office-inspired yet comfy landscape. When someone wanted to order a bottle of wine, the waiter kindly offered a second menu. The concept of shared dishes also really worked well for a larger group where you have different preferences.\n\nThe fusian food was overall of good quality for what we paid. A personal favourite was the Japanse pancake. On the flip side, a dish that could easily improve was the pavlova where the mango ice cream was too sweet and should be replaced with a more neutral and soft flavour like vanilla. Another minus was that a food allergy to cinnamon was communicated, yet the cookie served with the hot chocolate contained it which resulted in a very bad night for that person. Despite that, we were overall very happy and I would go back but be mindful with any odd allergies."",""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-03-10T07:12:35"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP9IssbE86OGaErbmLPTdVft-mZEPD41zmdV7Os=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNsy0LGL74IrSG5ouN1CXd8_kR0uI_jJJH0o88v=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIdTRTbnRRRRAB"",""rating"":1,""name"":""C.

The apple pine was the special dessert of today and it comes out very good. Thin flour, big pieces of apple and just right for the sweetness. We received only one dessert and waited really long for that.

Compared to other leading supermarkets, it is much more reasonably priced. Yet, the price tag in no way reflects a compromise on quality. Each piece of chicken looks and feels fresh. The flesh has a healthy color and a firm texture, a clear indication of its freshness. Whether you're planning to make a roasted chicken for a family dinner or a chicken salad for a light lunch, you can be sure that the chicken from this supermarket will work wonders in your kitchen.\n\nMoreover, it's not just the chicken. The entire range of products in the supermarket adheres to the principle of \""high quality at a low cost\"". You can find fresh produce, pantry staples, and even luxury items at prices that will put a smile on your face. The produce section is filled with a colorful array of fruits and vegetables, all of which look as if they were freshly picked from the farm.\n\nThe staff at this supermarket are also worth mentioning. They are always available to assist customers, whether it's answering questions about products or helping to carry heavy bags to your car. In short, this supermarket offers an outstanding shopping experience where you can get great value for your money. It is a place that I will continue to frequent regularly and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a supermarket that combines quality and affordability."",""published_at"":""a month

A good amount of places had kitchens closing for 830pm and couldn't accommodate us.\n\nToussaint was able to get us considering the late seating. The staff is courteous and attentive. The main room is small but warm and charming. We had a couple beers to start an Texel Skuumkoppe a delicious Affligem Blond beer both served perfectly.\n\nFor dinner we had the Chicken Special for the night which was a roasted chicken w lemon as seasoning , with side of potatoes and carrots. We also had the Sausage dinner w mashed potatoes and vegetables. Both dinners were good portions, but most importantly well prepared and seasoned and you can tell that the dishes were fresh and made to order.\n\nFor dessert we had the apple pie w ice cream and whipped cream and a slice of carrot cake. Both deserts were well made without any over sweetness and they hit the spot perfectly.\n\nOverall highly recommend this place for a quick lunch or casual dinner. Solid value for the food. Atmosphere is calm and quaint and very cute.

And the authentic Surinamese flavours still come forward amazingly. It's really an old-Dutch cafe type of vibe in terms of building style and wooden bar etc. But there are a lot of African and Caribbean elements woven into the decoration and interior. An interesting place to say the least. They have a beautiful community based collaboration going on with another Surinamese clothing brand: Patta!\n\nWhat did we taste?\n\nDrinks:\nGinger Beer\nMarkoesa drink\n\n-- Both intense and sweet! Which is something you'll mostly get at a Surinamese place. Eze and I both have a sweet tooth so this satisfied us amazingly. The Ginger Beer was authentically made following a Surinamese recipe. The Markoesa drink is like a passion fruit lemonade. One of my favourite things ever to drink, so I was a happy girl!\n\nAppetizers:\nBreaded fried plantain with peanut sauce (Bakabana)\nCassava fries with salted shredded cod fish (Telo Bakkeljauw)\nHome made fries (which they gave us extra!)\n\n-- Classics! Probably the best bakabana I've tried till date. Very nice and crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. And not too greasy as well. Peanut stew was delicious, and I'm picky when it comes to that. The Telo Bakkeljauw was really nice too and a bit of a surprise. I've tasted many different versions of bakkeljauw but this one seemed a little less sweet than I'm used to and also more fresh. So less artificial flavor enhancers (big fan of that)! The Telo becomes a bit dry when you leave it to cool for too long, but that's just how it works with fried cassava. The potato fries were simply amazing with a nice mayo to accompany it.\n\nMains:\nSurinamese authentic noodles (Bami, vegan)\nVegan Roti\n\n-- Both really amazing. Eze hasn't tasted much Surinamese cuisine before and therefore went on quite an adventure. I'm not new to the kitchen however but the flavors were really authentic and great, even with the vegan versions. Then you know what's up. They know how to cook here and you feel the love being put in the dishes. We loved it and the portions are large!\n\nWe literally didn't get to desserts because we were stuffed lol.\n\nMeo's Colosseum, thanks so much for your hospitality and love. May many more people come to invest in this black-owned authentic place in one of the hearts of Amsterdam (Oud-West).

The chicken is always great. I recommend the 14-piece hot wings bucket to take home, and I recommend the wrap if you want to eat mess-free in the car. Love the zinger fire stacker burger. They have great milkshakes too. Don't forget the sauces: I recommend the sweet & chili and the firestarter. Check out their app too for good deals from time to time."",""published_at"":""8 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-05-06T21:07:23"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMTzhusGt26UHTdzWLgPd6ZYJhu1MiIAJWdnJ8D=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURac1BQbmJ3EAE"",""rating"":1,""name"":""Roque Rodriguez Outeiral"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104837699862149531116?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""The food was completely spoiled because the drink was spilled.

We took a table near the bar and were surprised to see beautiful big parrot. That pure animal just an alive decoration here. She is not allowed to move from her stick. When she tried to walk out from her small place, waiter wrapped her in a towel, put back on stick and then start to spray with a water on parrot from all sides, like a punishment. The bird was screaming deafeningly. I really think it's not a best place for animal.\nAbout the food, we took a beef broth, which was tasty but looked very poor - only liquid and few mushrooms. We also took couple of beers and a snack plate for 21 euro and it was really bad looking, with rough crushed sausage, cheapest cheese and overfried snacks.

The ambiance inside was really nice--cozy, with just the right amount of lighting, which made the whole place feel warm and inviting. It was also clean, which is always a good thing. Plus, they had air conditioning, which was a lifesaver in this crazy hot weather.\n\nThe staff were super friendly. They were always ready to help, and their positive attitudes really added to the experience. The owner, on the other hand, seemed a bit stressed out, which threw off the vibe a little, but hey, everyone has their off days, so I won't let that affect my overall impression too much.\n\nNow, onto the food. The dishes were served in smaller portions, which I actually loved because it let me try a bunch of different things. I'm not super familiar with Spanish cuisine, so this was a fun way to get a taste of it. I don't eat pork, so I had to skip a few items, but everything I did try was absolutely delicious.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back, and I'm already thinking about bringing some friends along next time.

The tapas dishes were delicious, with plenty of choices and great recommendations from the staff. Correction: from a diligent, friendly lady with long curly hair, a deep voice, and a bandeau in her hair. A real gem! We found the dates particularly delicious. And the vegetables (grilled eggplant and broccoli) were also flavorful. The mussels were truly wow and definitely something to come back for. In short: a reason for me to return.\n\nIt's a shame that you sit so closely packed together. I prefer a bit more space and not having to hear the conversations of the neighbours.

The starters were fast, calamari was super good. But the waiter took it away even though we were still eating. Then two of the pastas my friend ordered were served cold, so they asked for new ones. They got new ones after the rest of us finished our food and it was apparently too cheesy although it was a truffle pasta. Two other friends' pastas were also too salty. I ordered a pizza with anchovies and even without the anchovies it was way too salty. It didn't feel authentic but the restaurant interior was very beautiful and spacious. It's nice for pictures but for food I would not really recommend. There were these frat boys who came with a big group and were being a complete menace. They were super loud, rude, and disrespectful. Everyone in the restaurant was uncomfortable. They would yell and swear, sing songs without being mindful of other customers. Some of them even threw up on the table which instantly made some of us lose our appetite. I wish someone would have told them to quiet down. I don't think i would come here again but if they work on their service and taste better then it has potential to be a restaurant with better ratings."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-14T00:33:37"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMZnb5IZBg8dyxL3ueYVU37xz9tWz0ADPOi9koQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN6POvkr9WPStuCe6KfB38-Zqvp-U8kR91rAg5d=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMANMom1gZf_7n1mzv-pcPdbktD5SEsBrAoMTU9=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNTWL52F213mZu4PH6-CXq9M2ZE9px08c4OAUXK=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzMXNHRFhBEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Justin Lucaci"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104529595333439976629?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Most Stunning Italian restaurant in Amsterdam-West!!

The tasting included 6 dishes plus a dessert at a great price, EU58/pp. Everything was phenomenal... flavors, textures, cocktails, service. I am still dreaming about the grilled calamari dish and all of its flavors. Every dish was unique, balanced and flavorful. I recommend making a reservation and eating here while in Amsterdam! Thank you for a great meal and experience!"",""published_at"":""7 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-06-12T12:35:52"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipObj6RgjsjZoygCSfqrZRr3u5hwKp8c_KHIyJXY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOI9X2E8wA8dPesC2yaiRq2X4yy1ELtyt5FgPAJ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPmdaE88AH3foWhM-hDGgz9QMTHU_duUz1RMCy6=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM3acapmpNXZTpsyFRJo3r33FwRNdqr72ZQB4WV=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPyeiTp3xk3KtVaUAl1DpGhhClc0XM9H3cnP9Ef=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOUI6hdXarywhAUXUSpHfYLn9eFem6gHq9pHhW0=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiaXRmY0hBEAE"",""rating"":3,""name"":""Aysun Urhan"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117383233918103919725?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Night Kitchen offers eastern Mediterranean food for shared dining. The atmosphere is cozy, it's appropriate for both a date or a night out with a large group of friends.\n\nWe were only 2 so we could try some of their dishes. Our favorites were the calamari with pickled cabbage and sour cream and the roasted aubergines. Overall the food is well made and they use good quality ingredients (especially that bread on its own is a win!) although persobally I found some of their dishes can be too a bit too complex, with several components that outshine one another. Nevertheless, it is a delicious experience, the portion sizes are generous too.\n\nTheir wine menu is big enough that you can find someone you like to pair with your food. We were happy with the service, the staff is kind and they're helpful. They offered one of their cocktails on house to all the guests when we were there, which made me think we should go back for their cocktails next time!"",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-25T16:39:50"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Aysun\n\nThank you so much for your visit and feedback.\nWe must say that after reading your review it seems you we're a bit cheap on the stars, don't you think? \nWe thank you and appreciate you anyway!\n"",""response_from_owner_ago"":""5 months ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2024-08-06T13:02:05"",""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP-nv4qIpV2dSlNMtHtZbqPCmpnPCvpIHiYvx-s=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN7l0kjrY55RUVRwrWWunStOe56RlSOl_t9Lg9B=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNn2cVpzuKbrRc1Iram6pcdL5LK9qx_SDSHBILY=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO1ODmJFVElTo2qoNp-0A3XE31MVYTFJIz9-d08=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNSAESI5TEAs_KyT2afkEzv8qYxRfoL7ohWfO3z=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN4vQKZprZQgW9KHId6nL4rb0PPOblVDGzqy98W=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP2fi_dSD8tlAgZfIFTJGW_ehDadLrMyODTWabV=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6aDZDQ2hnRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Aarushi Nudurupati"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106924108657618847865?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Dining at the Night Kitchen is such a wonderful experience.

Nestled in the heart of the city, this cozy eatery offers a delightful blend of Chinese Sichuan, Japanese miso, and Thai tom yum soup bases that will tantalize your taste buds.\n\nOne of the standout features of Mogu Malatang is the variety of vegetarian options available. You can choose from an array of fresh vegetables, assorted mushrooms, tofu, and different types of eggs to customize your noodle and soup combo. Each bowl is a flavorful journey, with the rich, aromatic broths perfectly complementing the wholesome ingredients.\n\nFor instance, my dish weighed in at about 380 grams and cost close to 16 euros, which is quite reasonable considering the quality and portion size. The staff also gave our complimentary edamame later on in the evening and I thought that was a very nice gesture.\n\nThe ambiance at Mogu Malatang is equally appealing. Whether you prefer indoor or outdoor seating, the restaurant provides a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. The indoor area is cozy and perfect for a quiet meal, while the outdoor seating offers a pleasant experience, especially on a cool day.\n\nWhat sets Mogu Malatang apart is the service. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive, always ready to help you navigate the menu and ensure you have a great dining experience. Their warm hospitality adds a personal touch that makes your visit even more enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, Mogu Malatang is a fantastic spot for anyone looking to indulge in delicious vegetarian noodles and soups. The only thing I wish was that it would have more variety to choose from, and that they would have some sauces available (like those in Asia) but other than that, it's a must-visit for comfort food lovers in Amsterdam."",""published_at"":""7 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-05-26T07:51:46"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for your lovely review "",""response_from_owner_ago"":""7 months ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2024-05-26T11:37:00"",""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNgh8ZoFwOfH_oBiGzkjPrqj1l8ph9eevfaUSyV=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP3ErzghS1fMPjw2tclV2pXKL1a5cQbAW05aYH4=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMmBZEE-pWcE69yY-mMIpFy5y_tqt-383261P4Q=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNoTyffitSNCxE3MGfE9DsUdeko6GxazuPhk9wh=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM6bTnBGn_oQr5QzjPR3D92N-f8iC1JMpgbw3ww=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPiL_JsrQUo1mGrnpPHAPqV3znXWg2DeFz91XtH=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP_0gd3lXwyQwDM58Fd5a161z-IrF5TLtG4sYXp=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNzq3Zo6ZqoH3JUQW497hEDQfxP7Z48QaE2jvQx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMLvN44BBHd31vHNMlF5ipT2LhdoFg2Of1qhvqg=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNdc0H3KLYXbRukuYcSC7TyeJheu7PVd61YuuSu=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOPX_ucgs5cf3HfsTr5DdmCz6xw_mLB-ydME-N6=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOMO0UUdaZqqFwp9SCGF1ajPoU0Dx7_rylNXPV_=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQal91d1RnEAE"",""rating"":4,""name"":""sam williams"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306184556497888166?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Loved the concept of choosing your food and all the plant based foods.

The bar does an amazing job of bringing in a Dutch influence--especially through their selection of local gins, beers, and snack options--while still offering a trendy, cosmopolitan feel that's appealing to locals and travelers alike.\n\nThe cocktails here are thoughtfully crafted, and the focus on quality ingredients makes a real difference. I love that they highlight Dutch elements without overdoing it; it feels authentic, not gimmicky. The ambiance strikes a great balance, too: it's stylish yet unpretentious, making it a comfortable place to sit back and relax, whether you're out with friends or just stopping by on your own for business.\n\nService-wise, they're efficient and friendly, which adds to the whole experience. Plus, the bartenders know their stuff and are genuinely enthusiastic, which makes for a nice interaction when ordering. All in all, I'd say Sorel's is one of those bars that's ideal for a memorable night out--cool enough for a special occasion but relaxed enough to visit anytime. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in Amsterdam and want a taste of the local bar scene with a twist of sophistication."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-12T19:45:05"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwa05IOElBEAE"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Dan Y"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110440573023607193491?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Good for a hotel bar/restaurant.

Amsterdam. It'd been 2 years since I'd been out in the city and I wanted somewhere reminiscent of the days before migration.\n\nBraai did not disappoint.. at all! In fact I'm surprised they're not on trip advisor's top 20 list of Amsterdam ribs' establishments. They should be. Some of the best ribs I've ever had - better than Cafe de Klos which were #5 on trip advisor's list. Tender without falling apart with an awesome BBQ sauce as glaze and dipping. Topped with caramelised onions was an awesome touch. There was a smokiness other places hadn't achieved. I'm pretty sure they used a Texas smoker as advertised on older menus.\n\nMy mate had the pork belly which to my taste was delightfully fatty and sweet with a gentle smokiness. I had just one bite so can't say much more.\n\nThe service was immediately friendly and welcoming. The server came by regularly but didn't crowd us. My mate took care of the bill (he's a keeper) and I'm hoping he tipped her. She was great!\n\nBeing off alcohol I was very glad to sample two zero percenters they had from boutique breweries - an ipa from... somewhere in the Netherlands; and Oedipus' \""Dorinku\"" Japanese inspired citrus beer. Twas a gooden.\n\nA great feed and a chill atmosphere 2 mins from Westerpark.\n\nHighly recommend if you love a South African Braai (bbq)."",""published_at"":""4 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-08-25T14:02:07"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM0KGfIQFULRdBlMZkOsGsrc6y9WhOjqeJslk1Q=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPYuiE9zpZq7uivsBJYhpHATvdBPNux_jeRVSoK=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzcjVHREhREAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Mac Birrell (Maccles)"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117166974542005752344?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Tucked away in Westerpark, I highly recommend this restaurant for the lovely service and hearty, yummy food.

We had ordered takeout from them before, and both times, it didn't disappoint. Everything was absolutely delicious and very warm. The chef cleaned our fish right at the table and served it on our plates. I didn't find their burrata particularly special though--it was just an ordinary burrata, not as creamy as I expected. As a surprise, they brought us a complimentary dessert and shot, which was such a lovely gesture.

After paying EU160 per person and reserving for six, we expected a memorable dining experience--but it was far from that.\n\nWe arrived at 9 PM, but the evening quickly went downhill. We waited almost an hour just to receive menus, as the waitress forgot to provide them. After another 30 minutes, our food finally arrived, but the quality was shockingly poor.\n*\tThe mussels with caviar were incomplete, with some missing the caviar entirely.\n*\tThe carpaccio was unappetizing and barely resembled a proper dish. It was also frozen.\n*\tThe tagliatelle with lobster was another disappointment--the lobster was empty, leaving only pasta in tomato sauce.\n*\tFor the mains, the beef, requested well-done, was served raw, and the salmon was excessively oily and tasteless. My wife even felt unwell after trying it.\n*\tBy the time dessert arrived at 11:45 PM, our appetite and patience were gone.\n\nThe waitress, clearly sympathetic, acknowledged our concerns and called the manager. He apologized and assured us of a full refund. However, we later received a call offering only half the amount as vouchers for the same restaurant--a poor resolution, especially as we live in Germany and are unlikely to return. When we spoke to the owner, she became defensive and unfriendly when we mentioned sharing this review.\n\nTo make matters worse, other guests around us voiced similar complaints about the service and food quality. It was clear that this wasn't an isolated incident.\n\nThis experience was unacceptable. Instead of celebrating New Year's Eve in a joyful and memorable way, we ended up hungry and disheartened on the streets of Amsterdam. We hope the restaurant takes this feedback seriously to prevent others from enduring such an unfortunate experience."",""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-03T17:13:14"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Mehmet, \nhereby my answer: \n-The mussels with caviar were incomplete, with some missing the caviar entirely. These were oysters and you never mentioned that 1 of those was missing caviar, we would offer 3 instead, like we did with soft drinks, since you were not drinking any alcohol ( bubble glas was included)\n- Carpaccio you ate it all and not shared anything about this issue\n- Linguine lobster you ate it all, and the portion was quite big, we put half lobster for every portion\n- Main: the 3 filets we offer an option but you did not want it, question: how many wives felt sick?, because this just happened while writing the review and never mentioned, not even in your first message...quite strange I can say!\nI think it is normal to became defensive if you or 1 of your group threaten you  and offend you!

They were delicious and came with a sweet spicy brown sauce.\n\nAnd then we ordered a salad and the one we got was the Som Tam Thai. Which was basically a papaya salad. I will say it was good. It was not our favorite thing we had at dinner. It was very refreshing. It's something I wouldn't order as my entire entree.\n\nThen we had the signature dish Khao Soi. This was absolutely amazing.

I wouldn't be surprised if she was still in training.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very quaint as it has a traditional italian look and is in the middle of a residential area, hidden from the busy streets.

We also had the Turkish red house wine, which is recommended if you love full bodied red wine. The staff is super friendly, thoughtful and genuinely radiate joy.

Pasta, especially the 40 egg variants were very well prepared with high quality ingredients.

I really loved the Amatriciana since the pasta itself was delicious, and cooked al dente. The pasta was incorporated with quite rich and intense tomato sauce, caramelized guanciale and pecorino romano. A bit heavy (which I like) but very well balanced, layered and simply delicious. Tiramisu was also very balanced in terms of flavours and textures. Not very sweet.

The homemade chili oil is very tasty as well and goes perfectly with the fluffy pizza dough.\nThe dessert menu is very straightforward with just two dishes, but it has a lot to offer. Both the tiramisu and the sweet foccacia are highly recommended. \nReservations in advance are recommended.
