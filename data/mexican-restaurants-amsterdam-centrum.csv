extremely central. We came here for an early dinner on Boxing Day with two adults and a child.\n\nWe ordered Jalapeno Poppers, Fajitas, Chicken Wings and drinks. Everything was served within an acceptable time frame and even though we only ordered one main dish, nobody looked at us in a funny way or made us feel less welcome.\n\nThe food was great. It's of course not the top tier authentic Mexican cuisine you'll find here, but we found everything to be delicious and tasty measured by European Mexican restaurant standards. Saying this is more of an Indian restaurant cause the food is spicy is nothing but ridiculous. Educate yourself before making a fool of yourself on the internet.\n\nThe prices at this restaurant are nearly unbeatable. Main courses come at around EU18 per dish, starters are EU8-10.

a 10 mins tram ride away from Amsterdam Central, The restaurant is at a good location with lot of other restaurants around it as well. As we entered the restaurant we really liked the vibes. Songs with cool beats in the background, nice friendly ambiance, perfect for the evenings for sure. In drinks we ordered Mexican beer Dos Equis and Margarita Miss Picantona. From the bites we ordered Jalapeno poppers and Totopos. The bites were really yummy and we enjoyed them with the drinks. We then ordered Tacos (chicken and veg), it was also really nice in taste. For the next round of drinks we ordered Michelada Special (beer + tequila)  and it was really great as well. The staff at the restaurant is very friendly and always happy to help with the menu. Overall a good experience and worth going in the evenings. Good to have reservation as it can get busy.\n\nPS: Although, must add that we found the place a relatively pricey as compared to other restaurants.

The guacamole was the best I've ever had, and the tacos were out of this world. Each dish was beautifully presented and made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The margaritas were also a highlight, perfectly balanced and refreshing.\n\nService was impeccable, with attentive and knowledgeable staff who were eager to make our experience memorable. The prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and service.

From Mexico to Amsterdam
How it all came to be...

It all started in 2001 when Los Pilones opened the doors at Kerkstraat 63 and introduced authentic Mexican cuisine in The Netherlands!

Los Pilones is a Mexican cantina style concept, serving fresh home made food and drinks in a colourful and vibrant atmosphere - a fiesta straight from Mexico to Amsterdam. You can drop in for tacos, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, fresh margaritas, micheladas, over 200 different kinds of 100% agave tequilas and mezcal.

The upstairs area is nice but its a bit small, maybe only 20 people maximum can sit up there but there is a nice view of the canal.  We started off sitting downstairs until a table opened up upstairs.  The employees were really nice in accomodating us which was great.  Then we started off buying a pitcher of Mango margarita. Really tasty margarita.  We also started off with some nachos. It was interesting to see cucumber on nachos but the nachos taste was alright. For the main course we ordered: a chimichanga (deep fried flour tortilla filled with beef, also came with rice, beans and salad), a burrito (chicken and beef, came with rice, beans and salad), Fajita Margarita and Vegetarian Chimichanga. The meat for the Fajitas were very flavorful. The Chimichangas were solid but the size was a bit on the smaller side.

We arrived on a Saturday night after being told in other places that they were full, so finding space here was great! The waitress warned us that the dishes were coming slowly and we accepted the condition. The staff was friendly and spoke Spanish although service was a bit sloppy and seemed to lack diligence.\nAfter waiting a lot for our food (we got first starters then ordered mains) everything was great! We were all very happy with the food.\nWhen we arrived I had ordered a margarita that took almost as much as the food to arrive and when it did it was salty. I (went down stairs to the bar and) asked the waitress if she could change it, she gladly did and the new one was good,    the wife of my boyfriend's brother ordered one too, although we missed the Margarita glasses (they were served in a long glass haha).\nOverall it was a good eating experience, if you are willing to be patient, we were warned about the longer times and the staff was nice to us, food was delicious and we had a great time.

You should get acquainted with flavor of the dishes before selling. Unfortunately this review is from a Mexican that has eaten Mexican Food around the globe. This is my least favorite. Guys the nachos... la sopa de frijoles... no way to rescue this review. Had not eaten all day... no even starving would recommend this place on my experience on this day.

I finally made a reservation for us.\n\nIt did not disappoint at all. My sister-in-law and I had the lamb chops, and my husband had the sea bass. It was delicious, and we really enjoyed it.

to be fairly standard - nothing particularly noteworthy, but comfortable enough for a casual dining experience.\n\nThe highlight here is unquestionably the food, which stands a notch above the ordinary. We started with the Nachos Sonora, which, while bursting with flavor, fell short in portion size, especially as a dish advertised for two. The toppings, too, were on the scantier side, which was a bit of a letdown.\n\nMoving on to the main course, the Combinacion Alfonso's was a mixed bag. The taco was average, failing to make much of an impression. However, the enchilada and burrito were a different story altogether - absolutely divine.

Worried why we were the only diners?  The food was served and it was absolutely fabulous.  So tasty.  We (Australians) found this Mexican / Argentina restaurat to be one of the best we have eaten at.\n\nMaybe this restaurant thrives on the Ballet & Opera evening show dinners and on NYE there was no evening show, hence why we may have been the only diners.

On one hand, the food and drinks were delicious. We opted for the taco Tuesday deal which was EU22 for one cocktail and two tacos. The cocktail was of high-quality and the tacos were very tasty. However, there were a few things which made this experience far from five stars. The price is quite high, I understand Amsterdam is quite expensive but even for Amsterdam I felt like the price was quite a lot. The food was good but the portions were quite small considering we spent almost EU50 on four tiny tacos. The interior design is very beautiful and cozy, however, we were seated against the wall  in what seemed like a waiting room with a tiny side table against the wall. When we arrived we were initially asked if we had a reservation and we said no, so we were told our choice was to sit at the bar or sit at the small tables. This is completely understandable as I understand places like this can be very busy so we were happy to sit at the small tables as we assumed it's very busy with lots of reservations. However, as time passed, we noticed that almost all of the tables and booths were empty with no one sitting in them so we wondered why we were told to sit in these uncomfortable small tables when there was an abundance of tables free. I assumed many people might not have turned up for their reservations but it felt a bit strange. A part of me wondered if it was because we weren't Dutch as there was a slight cold feel from the waiters that I couldn't shake off which really dampened the experience."",""published_at"":""6 days ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-07T18:07:08"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Ellie, \nThank you for sharing your experience at Restaurant Fiona. \nWe're sorry to hear that you felt the price-quality ratio didn't meet your expectations.

We're glad you found our place appealing from the outside, but we're sorry to hear that your experience with the arepas and patacones did not meet your expectations.\n\nWhen we processed your payment, we personally asked for your feedback and explained what had happened. It really helps us ensure you leave happy if you inform us right on the spot about any issues; we're always more than happy to make things right.\n\nWe have informed our kitchen about the size of the arepa, as they are typically larger, especially since they are meant to be bite-sized under our bites section on the menu. Thank you for your feedback; we will make sure the size of the arepa is always consistent moving forward. Unfortunately, you received a smaller size, but we could have addressed this immediately if you had let us know.\n\nRegarding the patacones, there was a mistake with the type of plantain used; we mistakenly used the slightly yellow plantain instead of the green one. We understand this mistake and will ensure accuracy moving forward.\n\nWe truly value your feedback and hope you'll consider giving us another chance to provide you with a better experience in the future.

Delicious modern Mexican food to enjoy by yourself or with friends/loved ones, nice drinks, good vibes, friendly and amazing personnel! I do recommend to make a reservation online just in case, just to make sure that you have a table reserved.\n\nTo start of I had the TACOS DE CAMARONES (2) with shrimp, chipotle crema topped with red cabbage and samphire. It was an flavour bomb!\nSo good! The balance of flavours was spot on!\n\nAfter that I had the SERE DE PESCADO\nPan, a fried corvina in a red coconut sauce.\nA Caribbean Mexican dish from the Garifuna community. It was soooo good!\nThe fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce just elevated the entire dish! The freshly baked bread that they also serve with the dish is great to scoop up all that tasty goodness off the plate.\n\nFor my 3rd meal I had the TACOS DE SUADERO (4), a Mexico City classic. Crispy fried beef brisket with a tomatillo salsa. It was tasty, and good hit of salt... although a bit oily (but that's just my personal opinion). The lime definitely helped to add some acidity to counter the saltiness and oily flavour.\n\nTo finish it off I had the caramel flan for dessert with a cappuccino + almond syrup on the side.\nA nice and sweet way to finish off the food experience!\n\nWould I recommend this place and come back in the future?
