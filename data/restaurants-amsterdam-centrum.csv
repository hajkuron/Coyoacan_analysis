However, once we sat down and ordered it took just over an hour for all of our meals to arrive. Parties who came in after us of 2-5 people received their main meals far in advance of us. The waitress who served us seemed impatient with us after our mains were served and she must've been at the end of her shift since after a few leading queries about whether we were finished or not, she never returned and we had to hunt down an alternative waitress to pay the bill since no one was around except by the bar. Mind the restaurant was open for another two hours at the time we actually left. Perhaps it's a culture difference...\n\nThe food on the other hand was delicious. We had the tenderloin, fish, and a fried Thai-esque dish. Dessert was also delicious despite the passive rush for us to leave. The gentleman who delivered the panna cotta was very kind and enthusiastic about the desserts that were being delivered.\n\nAll in all, good food with mediocre service. Those who deliver the food are kind, though from what I saw around us, if you are POC or don't speak Dutch, know you'll get a couple side eyes from the staff. Despite that, almost everyone spoke Dutch and English and had menus in both."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-25T20:59:04"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Grace,\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Their food and service are good, but this place doesn't really give you the atmospheric feel that they advertise on social media. It's a small room with screens. I liked how the theme matched everything - the food, the art being shown on the screen. It was great. But it didn't give us a WOW experience or anything to recommend others to try this place out. We took the wine pairing option. In the end, they ask you to go upstairs as \""desserts are served in heaven.\"" But it was not at all worth the hype. The least I was expecting it to have some fog atleast  after all that build up to especially go to a separate room. So we went there with a lot of expectations for the atmosphere but came out feeling like there was something missing overall. We spent around 380 euros for two. We also ordered a cocktail and a glass of champagne along with their Mother Earth themed set dinner with wine pairings."",""published_at"":""8 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-05-05T00:45:44"",""response_from_owner_text"":""We're grateful for your insights!

I come to Fulu every time to celebrate birthdays, festivals, and friends' graduations. I still remember the first time I came to Fulu for dinner was last winter. The academic pressure made me miss home, and my friend invited me to eat at Fulu. When I opened the door on the first floor, it was almost full of Chinese people, and the smell of Chinese food made me feel like I was back home. When I looked at the menu, I felt like I wanted to eat everythingAfter the dishes were served, everyone stopped talking and started to eat. I felt healed by the taste of home.\nWe ordered several dishes and I recommend the following ones:\n-Dry pot shrimp: The shrimp meat is full and chewy, delicious and spicy \n-Spicy chicken: Very layered, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, the taste of pepper makes me want to eat it unstoppably\n-Fish-fragrant eggplant: Although I occasionally make it myself, I still ordered it. It is completely different from making it with flavor packets. It is unexpectedly delicious and really amazing to eat with rice\n-Twice-cooked pork: The surface is shiny and slightly burnt. The meat is soft and chewy when eaten. It is fat but not greasy, lean but not dry. It is a must-order with friends every time\n-Dry-fried green beans: After coming here, I found that green beans are difficult to fry and difficult to make it good taste. This green bean is perfect.\nBecause the restaurant is in the tourist area,  it's beside Dam square and it's at the exit of Rokin subway station, you can often see tourists coming to eat. It is really kind to see people from my motherland when I am away from homeThe waiters are also very thoughtful and attentive, and I am very happy every time I come. I think it's the best Chinese restaurant in Amsterdam. If you miss the food of your hometown, and if you want to taste authentic Chinese food, come here for a meal!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-05T19:53:43"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Dear Carol J,\nWe're so pleased that you enjoyed the atmosphere!

It is more than worth the price from the service and presentation, to the symphony of flavors with each bite.  My girlfriend and I had the seven-course dinner (which was essentially 12 different items) and ordered wine separately.\n\nThe dishes appear small, but they are the \""Hermione's Purse\"" of flavor and satisfaction. Menu is attached. The one resting on a white, textured rhombus, I couldn't begin to describe. I have no ability to describe flavor--I'm sorry. But when I tell you I left my body for a moment, you MUST try this.\n\nNone of this meal disappointed. Trying to pick my least favorite dish feels unnecessary and difficult. It would be like trying to pick my least favorite song on a great artist's album. If you are in Amsterdam, you have to go to this restaurant.\n\nThe waitstaff was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable (and could make it graspable to a novice like me), and even gave history of the 17th century home that houses the restaurant.\n\nI literally have zero critiques. Dates, small family or group (2-4 people) dinners, a deeper way to celebrate life, this special place is perfect for it all.\n\nFor the price paid--EU328 for two people--for the breathtaking experience we had, for the way I am still, over a week later, thinking about this dinner, I am more than happy to write this review."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-03T20:48:26"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPe6pfGVoI5ePNbJWBiJqB8gw7iZMpa53ox-2YQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNkZRnmwv9R_mgI7sxefBw1k1M3soHJ_c4B72fe=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMONKss2wmrhrzZdpd1GtnKoKCHdxqS2QoeTAhf=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPVyHMpNt3G782ZTVxbVHSFZJRumPewL-FOUxUu=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN9Seu1NC6bPhGLRp_idFfrCol4QNKS6E1SZRNW=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNwPL8jQitLa2QVavLWW7V-iD5Xb_kJfktq2ZfI=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPV4V92J_AzSBqljCp62gMnXCIc_RJP7MMWWp5F=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN9V2T74lHjXgAQGjKoPPUJQOE5Yfmq5se2w7wm=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMvI1zQf17Q5RuKo6muGRlaBqzBfTudD01PPuNJ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPCk3-TI3OIqG8Fb6L15c6zWlri1moe2Q3W_v59=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMfJy6ZXgdZiz7fE2UktboECxyJDsvk_pUkOVH2=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOK5rtZihE0iQs_tE4q_5-YUj6DnDrCNcVxBQqv=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMIDERU0cLjv1BoXTKy_BwkGMTveJYxpRqsTXaD=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMUXvPYSjmYdekQIlgJi4kkLe4oRJDm5yIlvCAW=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuLXNhSEhREAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Jared Sands"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104812315526087366233?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Absolutely incredible meal in a very cool, historic building.

Housed in a classic Amsterdam building, the restaurant exudes a cozy and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe ambiance was delightful, and the staff were warm and welcoming. Seating is limited on the ground floor, and we climbed a steep, winding staircase to our reserved table on the second floor. While the restaurant was bustling, the service, though friendly, was notably slow.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Angus tenderloin, requesting it medium rare. Unfortunately, it arrived dry and closer to medium well. What I found particularly disappointing was that the steak did not come with a sauce. It had to be ordered separately--unlike my experiences in French restaurants. Instead, I had to pay extra for it, which felt odd. Dessert was a mixed experience--it was far too large, and the chocolate cake crumble was overpowering. Neither of us were able to finish it. A smaller, more balanced portion would have been preferable.\n\nDespite these hiccups, we enjoyed a wonderful evening in good company. Bistro Bleu is worth a visit for its ambiance, though a few improvements could make the dining experience even better."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-19T09:58:09"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey there, Eliane Muskus!

The food was amazing and the place was really lively, though we did start off a bit annoyed. But that didn't really spoil the whole fun evening.\n\nOn a busy Saturday night, I felt excited but also a bit mixed up. The bistro was full of energy, but we had a small problem at the start. We were sitting upstairs, kind of alone, and it took slightly more than 20 minutes just to get our drinks. This little mix-up was a bit of a letdown at first. And, trying to get a server's attention to order our food, even though they were close by, was a bit annoying.\nIt looked like people sitting downstairs got their orders faster.\n\nAs the night went on, any small issues we had at first were quickly forgotten because the food was just so good.\n\nStarters\nThe scallops were amazing - cooked just right and came with a really tasty pillow of peas that was a nice surprise.\nThe smoked salmon on toast was simple but really well done, with great quality ingredients that all worked well together.\n\nMain Courses\nThe French Fish Stew really stood out. It was a big, tasty mix of seafood, veggies, and a creamy sauce, and there was so much of it I couldn't even finish it all.\nMy partner had a Black Angus tenderloin that was just perfect - it looked great and tasted even better, especially with the peppery sauce that made it even more special.\n\nDessert\nThe Tarte Tatin with caramel ice cream was the perfect end to a great meal. It was just the right size for sharing.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBistro Bleu really shows off how good food and drinks can be, all in a lively and pretty place.\n\nThe slow service at the start was a small hiccup, probably because they needed more staff. And if you want your food faster, sitting downstairs might be a good idea. But honestly, the quality of the food stands out on its own, regardless of the wait.\n\nBistro Bleu is definitely a place you should try, with each dish feeling like it was made with a lot of attention "",""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-02-25T10:10:35"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNTnRRvgcR2pHBldthFKdxLv-i99sxWcdYGPvjP=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNhDe0bGirtLBzP9liT4uccvar12u1GP1aqNXxf=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOhrWL4QeTwAsyXcYp85HniIW0MsElczgcUEjh6=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNdx1M_JmlnUU9Zr2b-eYN7p5J6HjTy3-Z6BfZ_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNriVxbFhb_ut5bpZfPTnyYfVO36djfQWMduGOC=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmaGIzbWdRRRAB"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Rich Gollinge"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102121155104326895798?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""We walked in and smelled sewage. Should have turned around, but we didn't have reservations anywhere else, so we stuck it out. We ordered smoked salmon on toast, \""French\"" onion soup, steak tartare and the signature Bleu salad with grilled chicken. Oh boy, where to begin? The soup.. bland, flat, devoid of any flavor. The stock seemed to be chicken, maybe they dunked a chicken in hot tap water and boiled onions in it to call it soup. Smoked salmon on sourdough toast was also lacking in flavor, no presentation, but at least my wife got some protein. The salad was decent, fresh mesclun greens with half a hard boiled egg, house made vinaigrette.. But the chicken- was not only NOT grilled, it tasted like 2 day old baked baked chicken thigh uncovered in the fridge, then reheated for the salad. Steak tartare- well at least it was ground beef. However, it did not have the traditional encoutrements, and was served with white bread toast that was grilled. We spent nearly 100 Euros on this and to be honest, it was the worst meal we ate in Amsterdam. A 100 Euro meal should taste like one.

say it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish. We booked in advance, excited to try their renowned cuisine, and were immediately impressed by the elegant ambiance of the restaurant. The decor perfectly sets the stage for a delightful evening.\n\nWe opted for the chef's tasting menu for two, and it was nothing short of amazing. Each course was thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented, showcasing the best dishes that Ashoka has to offer. The portions were just right, allowing us to savor each flavor without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAmong the standout dishes, the butter chicken was a true highlight. Rich and creamy, it was bursting with flavor--definitely one of the best I've ever had. We also loved the masala, which was perfectly spiced and complemented the other dishes beautifully. Every bite was a celebration of Indian cuisine, and the variety in the tasting plate kept our taste buds excited.\n\nWhat truly enhanced our experience was the exceptional service. The staff were not only helpful but also genuinely friendly. They were attentive without being intrusive, making sure our dining experience was seamless and enjoyable.\n\nOverall, our evening at Ashoka was a wonderful culinary journey that we will be talking about for a long time. We can't wait to return and explore more of their delicious offerings. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience!"",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-21T13:05:20"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hello.

We had Chicken Choila and Chicken Momo. The Momo were a bit of a disappointment, as they were served cold. We were expecting them to be at least warm, considering how they're typically enjoyed fresh, but they missed the mark in that regard.\n\nHowever, the main course more than made up for it. The Kukhura Ko Masu (traditional Nepalese chicken curry) was absolutely on point. The flavour was rich, and well-seasoned. It was the highlight of the meal, and we really enjoyed it. It came with rice by default, and we added an extra garlic naan, which was delicious, warm, and perfectly complementing the curry.\n\nWhat really made the experience stand out was the service. The staff was exceptionally friendly, attentive, and accommodating, which made us feel very welcome throughout our meal. They were definitely a big part of the positive experience.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was also quite nice -- cozy, inviting, and with a relaxed atmosphere that made it perfect for a casual lunch."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-10T08:44:32"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP5aAbObprveemhzgTBJaaX52jUSAIVIJ2WjAbV=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPSPjN7kG-S--8LzrRKTMy7IU6lUH31vrXW5_wL=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNAl3-Cq2RCD9pEBNl4japwwETwZauSLm1Vi-u4=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOyx3R-h4LlGB_sauisilFF6ZrFFiUkkmH8oq0f=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNjPP1m4Qba2Vh0qmX40ioeCTmNXhCyQWTa37jg=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPKThkkJ2_ZBeg4gFxZng4UVWLhhKC7JCbuVuY0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPQe6ffBnjp3sRJF9pp5iut7MsfC5WlTFdguKms=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNKjXjjryI6tgOsCijAxgFTECW_VRjGoT-ZNuYs=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzODY2MXFRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""amy o'toole"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115376957273618023539?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""My favourite restaurant in Amsterdam!

When we arrived we were greeted in a friendly way and given a nice table. After about 10 minutes the sommelier, asked if we wanted to see the wine menu, but we were not given the food menu's. So we decided to just have a glass of wine, since we had no idea what we were going to be eating. I further found the way that the sommelier acted was a bit arrogant and patronising. I can maybe understand it if he would be working in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but not in a bistro.. The food was fine, bouillabaisse, tartare de boeuf and goose liver for starter were fine. We decided to have the special of the day, which was a beef Wellington for two. As it was for two, I expected it to be a small Wellington or similar, but I was surprised when they just served two slices of Wellington on a plate. Why did this have to be ordered for two people? It came with some salad and fries. The beef was nicely cooked, but the pastry was very soggy and for some reason they had wrapped the inside layer (which I assume was a crepe) with lettuce leaves, which was a first for me in a Wellington. So I was not blown away, and my son told me he preferred the Wellington I make at home.. My wife's bouillabaisse was fine. She did throw up all night, but we are not sure what caused that, and as I had the same thing as a starter and I had no issues, I don't think it was the bouillabaisse. But overall, we left with mixed feelings, and I am not in a hurry to return."",""published_at"":""2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-28T18:09:21"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're truly sorry to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations. As a restaurant known for our hospitality, it's very disappointing to hear that the service, did not reflect the warm and welcoming atmosphere we strive to create. We will certainly address your comments with the team to ensure that all guests feel valued and well looked after, as this is a key part of who we are.\n\nRegarding the Beef Wellington, we apologize for any confusion. Our Beef Wellington for two is a substantial dish, and it's often more than one person can comfortably enjoy when paired with starters and dessert. We always recommend sharing it if you plan on having multiple courses, but we understand that the information around this might not have been clear. We'll make sure to better communicate this in the future to avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your wife's discomfort. While we take food safety and quality seriously, we're glad that you didn't experience any issues yourself. We will continue to review our practices to ensure the highest standards are consistently maintained.\n\nWe truly hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future and provide you with a better experience."",""response_from_owner_ago"":""2 weeks ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2024-12-29T20:51:20"",""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM08Sy5C5fyamds0PSJ5xNVHQbugYZOeU6sCWfM=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2ODR1bVlREAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Ben"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108914984818892658253?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Experience: Magnifique!

To culminate our trip in Europe, we went to fine dining restaurant and this is it! The restaurant features a great ambience overall in a two story building with an alfresco area. Surprisingly, a detailed menu is kept as a secret until you each dish is served on your table. What a suspense! And the food presentation is astonishingly beautiful, not to mention, the refined style of meaty flavor from baby lamb and some fish. The staff was kind enough to explain how the food was created and cooked in what ingredients. Everything was on point and the taste was divine. Had it been with a wee bit well-decorated interior, I would've enjoyed even better.

After about 10 minutes one of the servers greeted us and pointed to 3 two tops in the lobby that we could sit at.   We basically sat in the bar/lobby where the servers made drinks and closed out tabs and greeted the guests who came in without reservations or it was too late for the kitchen.

The interior is small and colourful with a laidback vibe.\n\nMy friend enjoyed the pepper pot for dinner and I ordered the jerk chicken. Eating jerk chicken in Jamaica would set your mouth on fire so the restaurant tones down the spice nicely, without eliminating it altogether. The result was a generous serving of very tender and juicy chicken in a flavourful jerk sauce that still had some bite to it.\n\nWhile is typical to drink beer with this meal, we opted for Piscos, which were well balanced and delicious.\n\nThe service was friendly and helpful.

At a high price, as with the other dishes. Even though the spare ribs tasted good, they are not worth EU22 for the amount, not even in Amsterdam. The Eastern European lady, on the other hand, was very nice and in a good mood. Unfortunately, one of the few positive things about our visit.

The restaurant offers a variety of well-cooked steaks, with the Lomito being a popular choice among patrons.\n\nThe steak quality is very good, and the meat is cooked to perfection. The location is convenient, being close to Dam Square, which makes it an easy choice for tourists exploring the area. The staff is friendly, adding to the positive dining experience.\n\nHowever, the restaurant's setting is quite simple, with basic chairs and tables. It's not a fancy place, so don't expect a luxurious ambiance. Steaks are served on their own, and you need to order sides separately. While some might prefer this, it can be a downside for those who expect a complete meal without additional charges. Additionally, the staff, while friendly, can be a bit slow, which might affect the overall dining experience.\n\nOverall, CAU Steak Restaurant is a great choice for those looking to enjoy good steak near Dam Square.

The dishes were delicious, and it's clear the chefs put a lot of care and skill into their work. Hats off to them for creating such a memorable culinary experience!\n\nHowever, the overall experience was unfortunately marred by the service. We made a reservation for 9:00 PM, but just ten minutes after we arrived, we were told by the waiter that we needed to order immediately as the kitchen was closing. This was surprising, as we had reserved well in advance and received no prior notice of the kitchen's early closing. It left us feeling rushed and questioning the purpose of our reservation time.\n\nThe service also lacked a touch of professionalism. Our waiter brought cutlery to our table but placed it in the middle without distributing it, unlike the attention given to other tables nearby. Furthermore, when a small accident occurred and water was spilled on me, the waiter simply smiled without an apology, which felt dismissive and unprofessional.\n\nWhile the food is truly excellent and worth coming back for, the inconsistency in service creates an unfortunate imbalance. I would recommend the restaurant to those who value great cuisine, but I hope the management considers improvements in staff training to better reflect the quality of the kitchen."",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-31T01:34:43"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuLWJDZm1RRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Marc Davison"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107529951043714339563?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Superb meal.

Cooked excatly the way we asked for, juicy and tender.\nBrussel Sprouts, Beef and Mushrooms Bruschettas were tasty but nothing special.\nFor deserts we ordered Chocolate Crumble  - was really nice and Baklava - the weakest link of the night and the menu.\n\nService was really attentive and even took their time to discuss our feedback with us.\nWe enjoyed our meal and time at Black.

a 10 mins tram ride away from Amsterdam Central, The restaurant is at a good location with lot of other restaurants around it as well. As we entered the restaurant we really liked the vibes. Songs with cool beats in the background, nice friendly ambiance, perfect for the evenings for sure. In drinks we ordered Mexican beer Dos Equis and Margarita Miss Picantona. From the bites we ordered Jalapeno poppers and Totopos. The bites were really yummy and we enjoyed them with the drinks. We then ordered Tacos (chicken and veg), it was also really nice in taste. For the next round of drinks we ordered Michelada Special (beer + tequila)  and it was really great as well. The staff at the restaurant is very friendly and always happy to help with the menu. Overall a good experience and worth going in the evenings. Good to have reservation as it can get busy.\n\nPS: Although, must add that we found the place a relatively pricey as compared to other restaurants. The food is quite overpriced."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-06-30T07:36:18"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN0btJAO2_eDsnrzvUaU-xrJ7mP2JvHEWo3nD6u=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPWNoEzYJHiRfrxHiycqdcNcxhRVvY8fJVDk7I_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOChBVyydwssMAZGJInoc1QFKHb_3TwfTHKAAea=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNDv9jaavA2Iac0ygTh4jcXM7gP25dqCP5KG99_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP-MWavCKPl1IoUAJt_Q-2tLe85tjwysRexOoDQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNx46f-3ejoZ_8FRHfRi2j7Xtir_-EPlcmKmbEk=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPK-KwDLZaq3mFQrQ5QHOTHNASZEfUx8C9kZOhy=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzeWFXVmh3RRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Anna Tulkis"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113033021691749413262?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Great restaurant!

We peeked inside and a bunch of locals so we knew we were in the right place! Our servers Valeria & Long truly made the dining experience here very pleasant and memorable! Valeria from Venezuela was very friendly, attentive and well knowledged on all the dishes offered! She highly suggested the steak, pea soup and the catch of the day which we were very lucky to have tried! Very flavorful and delicious! Long from Vietnam gave us some great tips to further enjoy our visit to Amsterdam. We will certainly come back here again when we visit again next year!

Not just any story; the first page dates back to 1904 when our building became the base of Dutch newspaper 'De Tijd'. With a history like that, it's no surprise PRESSROOM is still a place ''where stories are yet to be written''. Today, this rich history is translated into a relaxed experience with a modern and personal approach. In 2023, PRESSROOM has been awarded with three awards concerning the cuisine and the design of the restaurant. PRESSROOM lives from early morning until late at night simply because the story must go on.

The interior is minimalistic but the branding is very cool. All in black and white, which comic sketches on the wall that illustrate the story of the restaurant chain. (There are locations in the city center and now also in Noord)\nThe Menu relies on Manousheh (Lebanese wraps) and a selection of sides and soups.\nThey also offer the soup on larger quantities for you to keep in your freezer for later.\nThe Manousheh come with beef, chicken or lamb, veggie and vegan options. So\nThere is literally something for everyone. I had the Haloumi Zataar and my boyfriend had the beef and Labneh. Both were delicious! Super authentic and very filling.\nStaff is friendly and the food was there in no time.

The first time, I arrived early in the morning. They were only serving drinks and pastries, so I decided to get the croissant.\n\nI was amazed how this croissant was so light, flaky, and buttery. I would have never guessed it was vegan. As I walked thru the streets eating my croissant, I kept wondering how this could be 100% plant based. It was that good.\n\nI originally went there looking to try their sandwich, so the following day, I walked 2 miles from my hotel to get one. I ordered the Crispy, and again, I was amazed at how delicious it was.  Just note, this is a small shop. They have a couple of benches outside that I happily sat and munched on my sandwich.\n\nMargo's is in class of its own when it comes to 100% plant based.

We chose the all you can eat then he came to our table and explained that some of the options are not included in all you can eat which was a bit unfair after we chose this option so technically it is not worth it. The food did not meet our expectations, the sushi was super dry. I would recommend trying the smoked shrimps which were really good and the miso soup.

Food is prepared very fast. Rolls were nice and had a good amount of fish. Salad was boring and dry. Same as poke bowl. Hostesses at the reception desk are awful. I think it's important to understand that it is not a street market level of place to keep shouting and create a chaos. One person answers the phone and then the second one takes over the phone instead of helping guests in the line. Then one of them asked you how she can help and then takes the phone from another host and you wait again. Very messy.

At first glance the design of old space is beautiful, but then you meet a waiter, who gives you sort of annoying look and then ignores you, so you just pass by and search for a table by yourself. We took a table near the bar and were surprised to see beautiful big parrot. That pure animal just an alive decoration here. She is not allowed to move from her stick. When she tried to walk out from her small place, waiter wrapped her in a towel, put back on stick and then start to spray with a water on parrot from all sides, like a punishment. The bird was screaming deafeningly. I really think it's not a best place for animal.\nAbout the food, we took a beef broth, which was tasty but looked very poor - only liquid and few mushrooms. We also took couple of beers and a snack plate for 21 euro and it was really bad looking, with rough crushed sausage, cheapest cheese and overfried snacks.

The chicken is not fried correctly and thus causing it to be soggy and almost inedible. I cannot believe that I even had to paid for this piece of chicken that is just a soggy piece of trash on my plate. The salad does not even have dressing on it!!!! The whole plate of food is just so obviously taken out of a fridge or a freezer and just reheated. Never come here, they basically just scam tourist people for their money. If you ever see a crowd in the restaurant it is 10000000% tourist groups that were brought into this restaurant forcibly.\n\nOn top of that, when we complained about the chicken being soggy to the manager. The manager replied to us rudely and asked us what should he/she do? As if to mock us.\n\nIf you ever come to this restaurant please close the menu and walk back out before ordering anything. But if unfortunately you have ordered food and thought that it was garbage, please rate it as so here.\n\nThank you for reading this and I hope that this restaurant will improve itself.

Work done, body frozen, treat required. Behold! Opposite the Bijenkorf right on Dam Square, Royal 98. I'd never been before and I was actually heading somewhere else, or at least I thought I was, but then I caught sight of a flash of irresistible gezelligheid and I was in.\n\nInside I was greeted, given a choice of tables and accommodated in a timely and professional fashion. Warmhearted but not overbearing. Just right.\n\nThe menu was delivered. I perused and made my choice. Pappardelle beef ragu. House red.\n\nFrom my high table at the back of the front section of the restaurant, I could see out across Dam Square, so twinkling and beautiful and Christmassy that you can just about convince yourself the world isn't really ending. Ditto Claudia Cardinale, on the wall to my left.\n\nMy wine came. And it was good.\n\nThen my pasta came. And it was excellent. Succulent beef. Toothsome pasta ribbons. Damn near perfect. Made me feel guilty in all kinds of ways.\n\nThen I noticed one of a nearby party of Germans order an Irish coffee and I had to have one. I also saw that there was a ten-euro tiramisu on the menu. And I had to have it. To say both were excellent would be an understatement. The tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had. The textures were ... almost moving. I could have eaten it a hundred times. Even the little sprig of mint was a triumph.\n\nThe staff too, were excellent. Two guys, Hans and Robert. Dutch guys! Dutch service is frequently diabolical but these guys were outstanding. As the restaurant became busy, they wordlessly catered to every table, every group, quickly, efficiently, and with genuine alacrity. There was one moment as they were pottering away behind the bar, that they started laughing together, and I liked that very much. Happy staff, doing a job they clearly enjoy and consequently doing it very well indeed.\n\nMaybe I got lucky. I mean, I definitely got lucky because I can't think of a single weak point. It's not cheap, but of course it's not -- look where it is. But it's worth it. I didn't begrudge a penny. The decor is also great and supergezellig and there was a pretty decent Christmas soundtrack playing throughout.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say this was one of my favourite Amsterdam dining experiences and I will remember it for the rest of my life. It's personal, you know? It just hit the right spot, in the right moment, and everything was perfect.\n\nWholeheartedly recommend."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-10T13:40:49"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMpTphaS-GMUy_IwCnEEQ5ndJVC2y_oIGHyeufS=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNqKnMgtdJLcnE7wDaVMELzfzYnxPkkMQ6oy0ih=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6NEppSzVRRRAB"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Abdulrahman Alzamil (Zamil)"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111555237844996092010?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""My experience at this restaurant in Amsterdam was fantastic!

We ordered the cheese fondue as an appetizer and it was outstanding and delivered quickly.  My wife even said it was better than some of the fondues we have had in Switzerland!\n\nI had the fish and chips and my wife had the burger--both were very good (along with the beers!) and the staff was helpful and attentive.\n\nAs I said above, the only negative was the length of time to receive our main courses, about 1 hour.\n\nI had seen another couple receive the same order we had (fish and chips, burger) and after about an hour, I was about to ask the staff about our order but before I could, our order was brought out to us.  The food was very tasty and piping hot so it was freshly prepared.\n\nEven though we were eating well before the normal dinner time, it could have been just a surge of customers.

I loved the atmosphere and overall vibe, I immediately felt like we were in a fancy legacy french restaurant.\n\nI liked everything I tried, even the pate which I tend to not care for. I mean I didn't love it, but the subtle twists and overall quality made something I tend not to like into something I'd eat again! I was also pleasantly surprised to see my favorite wine on the menu.\n\nDefinitely the meat dishes are the draw. Most are served with great crusty bread. Few bites of food are as satisfying as fatty and creamy bone marrow over chewy crunchy bread.\n\nI liked the fish dishes and I had a vegetarian dish was well, but I was most impressed with the meat dishes.

In general, the food quality was good but the some flavors may have been adapted. The staff was friendly but you had little chance to interact because of the QR code ordering system. The place was small and cozy but could get noisy when being full.\n\nWe ordered prawn spring rolls for appetizer, bun bo Hue (Hue styled beef noodles) and bun thit nuong dac biet (special grilled meat noodles with salads). Both main dishes were generous in the amount of meats, large portions and had decent taste. The beef noodles however lacked the typical deep fermented shrimp flavor that made it Hue-styled. The salad noodles had many types of meats whose flavors competed each other.\n\nMaybe the pho and banh mi would be better according to many reviews  but we didn't try them."",""published_at"":""11 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-02-10T17:03:40"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNkncT55U1JlOxb2Xz2gy7_Jur07BYt8IPk29jF=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPau-38KFgqr9dEXLsvDJ1im9Sgl0lfuAuXptze=s1024""]}]",[],restaurants amsterdam centrum

We actually thought is was an Italian restaurant with all the pizzas in the window. Luckily they were able to accommodate us, but then we realized that this was a North African restaurant, so we reluctantly went in knowing we had three picking eaters in our group, including our 17 year old son, our 10 year old daughter, and myself and never having North African food before. We sat down and ordered and our son and daughter said it was the best meal they had on vacation and maybe ever. Wow! The food was amazing, the atmosphere was nice and cozy, like having a meal in a friends home. The wait staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. What a great experience.

It's definitely something for foodies who like to eat healthy, organic food and are still looking for something you can't easily recreate at home. The Eggs Florentine are also highly recommended, a little \""simpler\"" than the vege breakfast. The pancakes are also good, but I was personally more impressed by the savory dishes, which is probably a matter of taste.

She absolutely does not even care!! Note that there are 5 staffs on the floor and 4 cooks behind the counter.\n\nSecond, ordered the \""tom yum ramen\"", the dish portion is very small, even compare to those wagamama I have been in UK or Belgium. Furthermore, the dish is not ramen at all, it is flat white noodle! It's absolutely a joke! The most ridiculous is.... the dish is supposed to be with prawns, but, size of those are so small that they should not even considered as shrimp, let alone being called prawns! Then, the appetizer came after the main, which once again shown that the staffs just DO NOT CARE!\n\nThe cashier, probably the owner, asked me for feedback when I paid the bill at the front at the end. I did provide some candid feedback on portions/sizes of the dish!

Immediately forgetting much of what I was eating may have worked in my favor, as I was able to detach from my expectations and just enjoy a completely invigorating sensory experience. Each course presented something as appealing to my eye as to my tongue, an exciting adventure all around.\nThere was plenty of time between each course, probably more than I would've liked. Altogether, my 5 course dinner took around 2 and a half hours. I only wish I'd brought a book to read between courses and people-watching.\n\nThe atmosphere was distinct. The design of the restaurant was industrial yet laid back. Rustic wood decorated the walls amidst tiles and concrete. A beautiful bright red ceiling balanced the slate gray of the floors. As a solo diner, I enjoyed taking it all in, watching the staff's impressive coordination and attentiveness as they moved through the dining area. My only qualm with the space itself was the bathrooms - clean enough, but between the small space and its position next to the coat rack, it felt a bit closet-like.\n\nAt 70 euros (not including wine pairings or other extras), the 5-course [vegetarian] menu was a more than worthwhile experience. Those dishes will stick with me, and they left me feeling inspired to seek out more adventures for my palate.

We had the mushroom tacos which were super tasty, the cauliflower wings (also great) and (the cherry on top) roasted Yacon with mole sauce. The Yacon really surprised me! The mix of the rather crisp and sweet tasting root mixed with the roasted aroma and the mole was perfect!

Don't short yourself--you deserve to taste every thing this establishment had to offer.\n\nEach course is delicately prepared. Every component is delicious in its own right and becomes part of a symphony when combined and paired with the wines. Han's explains the wines and courses in a matter of fact way, though with the underlying playfulness that you need for a good menu. He is personable and delightful.\n\nThe chef is an invisible force, creating her complex works of art in the kitchen. But you can see her dedication and desire to make good food in every plate. I'll confess, I poked my head in the kitchen to show my appreciation and she smiled in return.\n\nThe food and wine play together, highlighting different elements.

Although the ingredients are simple, the flavors and presentation are captivating. There are five courses (EU95pp) with the option of a good or exceptional wine pairing at higher rates. We opted for a nonalcoholic dinner, but friends who have visited highly recommend the wine pairing. Note that it's important to make a reservation in advance and even more important to confirm it when the owner reaches out via email, lest your reservation gets canceled. Which would be a real shame.\n\nThe pork cheek was absolutely delicious, the cod melts in your mouth like a warm hug, and the nectarine iced dessert was hands down the best dessert we've had in a long time. As for what can be improved, the first course of brined tuna was only good, not great. The various elements in the dish didn't love each other, the union more closely resembled an arranged marriage. However, the one thing I'd really change is the bread; no butter on Earth can improve the experience of crunching on a rock hard dinner roll. Those minor points aside, we had a delightful dinner and left more than satisfied.\n\nMy partner loved how intimate the atmosphere felt. It's like you're in someone's home, and they're taking good care of you with the freshest ingredients. Their dog, meandering around without a care in the world, adds to the cosiness."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-09-15T12:01:34"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":2,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPLo3f70jeCzSK3xAd_b5JSsIfyN7fvkwGj_5L_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPE8ss2q4DXgcIfCFBBKZGfbVmYVGh2HqIYSrqd=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP4VIJ41y1XazZFSeZKKowREgiZqVvrj_fD8vMh=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNOcOb9GlwNjq26tuMt-qNmGlgSGWnMK9Ofd40D=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOblNfTmbBxSfOHW8lDgFEWsVCsKqWyQ5D7NnH8=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNM1a43mv_mZmmeqQK6AQYrsxsQwps7mBaFQuGr=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOVkGvvbnZE5YBi9kqU_7Njzd79HM-x9iiIfyYW=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYamRfWktnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Mikayla Durham"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100570112109905887913?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Hands down the best meal I've ever experienced.
