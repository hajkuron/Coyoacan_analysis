ChIJLbRQRA0JxkcRmBIpyM1uNmg,Pompstation | Restaurant in Amsterdam,"Bij Bar Restaurant Terras Pompstation kom je voor Wining & Dining onder het genot van fijne jazzy live muziek op de achtergrond

Onze menukaart heeft een ruime keuze uit duurzaam vlees, vis, vegetarische en veganistische gerechten waarmee je een 3, 4 of 5 gangen keuzemenu kunt samenstellen uit alle gerechten.

Op vrijdag, zaterdag en zondag (soms ook donderdag ) zijn er live muziek optredens op ons podium. Meestal Jazzy & Soulful, soms Tango, Bossa/Nova of mooie Singer/Songwriter liedjes.

And for those who went for his special menu, he brought over the dishes, and explained to them what they were.\nI had the crayfish cannelloni, which was delicious, and the mille feuille for dessert, which was not only great, but the presentation of it was beautiful too.\n\nTheir dishes are designed for sharing with others, so you should probably other two or three in one go (depending on how many people), but one dish for myself was enough.\nThe floor staff and the chefs were both lovely.

Not just because the food is amazing and the restaurant beautiful... but because for a Michelin Starred restaurant a 6 course meal for less than 100EU is practically unheard of. Located in an urban park in Amsterdam within a restored greenhouse, De Kas sources its fresh produce from its own organic garden next to the restaurant and local farms in nearby Beemster. The service was friendly, welcoming and professional. Our server made some excellent recommendations for all adults and the two young kids with us. I had the 6 course meal with wine pairings which added an extra EU48 (still under EU150 for 6 courses and 4 wines! )\nI particularly loved the crispy mushroom tacos, the house beet salad and the venison with truffles.

Further, you MUST make a reservation and typically about 2 months in-advance!  Why, you ask... Because De Kas is a one-of-a-kind dining experience! A massive greenhouse located in a park is home to this unique restaurant that truly serves farm-to-table foods (proteins are sourced elsewhere). You will be seated with 2-3 small snacks already on the table with additional amuse-bouche items sprinkled throughout your meal. You can select 3-4 courses for lunch and 5-6 courses for dinner with delicious and creative dishes coupled with impeccable service. Courses are sized and spaced out beautifully so that you never feel full. Servers are very knowledgeable and will assist with wine pairings if you ask. Note that this is a dining \""experience\"" and they book your table for 2.5 hours when you reserve so you can dine at your leisure. While this fabulous meal could easily cost EU150 or more, their 6 course dinner is a bargain at EU88. Book well in-advance and go!\n\nNote: De Kas uses fixed menus, there is no a la carte option though any meal can be made vegetarian or vegan."",""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-02T20:21:45"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN-R-HN4ak7le948FuP3OMSyZgTBahNJGcNGkSn=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMUv3eZAk00wB2Dn1onDE057YWamTJCR0F1GKEK=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM3iTdhp_Kz2qJwkATvXjXMD_KWH_Uztss8tNUP=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipME5mecTwZT4e8CNswZhcQZ8NBEvBPEUa6Aq9mx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOVwcJjPQMhzkvle32jfL2xewQ5FwbkqP7lTOcO=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNyWrDVUPrX3-pMVU64wOp5KnmVsCGFE1hBmlaL=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOzfN8rZBrFUi3q49eqPwcPIuty14-kAPAD50-N=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNuR3XyMNUeZ2g8mUYptW3i0jCSleFn10k39-Qu=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNPDF6RtYwJJItGp0pNQwz8vFkrqIC63sYR_XFs=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzLTRfQU13EAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Yu-Ting"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107665708853861628663?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""I am happy to finally have the opportunity to eat here.

I've tried new things but also experience foods we love in a new way.\nWe thought it was great value for money too.\nSurely this restaurant is on the way to Michelin stars!\nCan't wait to visit when we are next in Amsterdam."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-04T16:36:29"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM6nPpBVAb5TEB3QQLq62ppEWmQ1bHsX__Xyxvs=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNizgPL_8l5vwwGRCycBaSbNclilxg70R0rPJrc=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOCRX3BRrOJclLtQjDb8AO3s5ZBQ43hNdON6lX8=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipME5Z4znaIE83Yqb-YzN_p_hKAvtT6_Cajbf-nI=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNGTk4hVtnm4FeYbQssqJOdIxqxih4lU4i0kKMo=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2dUxUQ1hBEAE"",""rating"":3,""name"":""esin durmaz"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117492108367720384662?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""We ordered the 5-course tasting menu, and the entire dining experience lasted 4 hours.

However, three out of four dishes contained nuts, instead of providing alternatives they simply removed elements that played a significant role (pistachio crumble; butter sauce with hazelnut). While the food itself was well-prepared and flavorful, the lack of consideration for his allergy was disappointing.

For me, this restaurant is one of the best I have ever tried; the food tastes perfect. (And I have tried a lot of restaurants.) The service was just as good. The service was simply top-notch; the waitress and waiters were very friendly and helpful, just like the kitchen staff who prepared the food. The only thing I found negative is that the prices were quite expensive. We paid around 120 to 130 euros for five people, but this could be because the situation here is different--I'm from Berlin and this is my first time on vacation in Amsterdam, so I can't really assess whether the prices are normal for Amsterdam. All in all, I would recommend everyone to go there and try it out.

The food is quite varied and savory, the service is attentive, and the cocktails are quite creative and are some of the best ones I've had in Amsterdam. Additionally, the place has a great view of the south and east part of the city, which makes for a beautiful atmosphere.\n\nAs for recommendations here is what I would encourage you to try:\n1. The Japanese Gin Fizz is out of this world and my all time favorite.\n2. The bitterballen are delicious and are made with good quality ingredients.\n3. The roast beef bread was so fresh and the flavor combination adds so much to the dish, however I do have to say that I prefer the bread to be warm.\n5. The roasted pumpkin salad is quite refreshing, nevertheless I do think that it tastes better if some salt is added and it would perhaps be more savory with some balsamic or honey as dressing.\n6. The white chocolate cheesecake is the only way to properly finish off the meal as it is creamy and savory.\n\nAs a final note, I do have to mention that the service attention decreases as lunch hours are ending so I would recommend you to consider going before 15:30 for attentive and quick service.

The wild deer meat was exceptional--tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. It's an absolute must-try. The duck liver, reminiscent of foie gras, had a very rich flavor. They also offer an extensive wine selection. However, the alcohol-free wine served from cans was a letdown, as it lacked the elegance you'd expect. While the charm of the old-school building adds to the atmosphere, the interior could benefit from some renovation.

Starting with fish appetizer, crunchy melting pork belly and homemade icecream with cake. All come in good portion and food made with love. The restaurant has an eco concept, own garden and only seasonal ingredients being used. Service was friendly and attentive. So nice they served free water Highly recommend and thank you for such great experience.\n\nOnly complaint: ordered warm cocktail (7.50 euro) but it came with ice cubes and hence the taste has dilluted the already not strong cocktail. Cocktail presentation was not chic at all.\n\nUpdate as of June 2022: 3-gangen surprising menu was still a plesant surprise. The octopus was done in wooden oven. Love the smokiness. Still, nothing beat the Crunchy Spek! Homemade Lemonade costs 12 euro per garaf.\n\nUpdate as of July 2022:\nMaincourse of chicken is overpriced, the 1/4 chicken witg few mini potatos and cabbage costing about 25 euro, and it wasn't cooked thoroughly. A big dissapointment because I've brought guests. The Tussengerecht of lemon spaghetti was too sour, overpowering lemon made it unpleasant. Portions were small.

At 8:53, we went to the counter to place our order. That's when the staff, with a rather irritated tone, reminded us that we had entered too early and asked us to leave.

From the moment we arrived, the welcoming atmosphere set the tone for an exceptional evening.\n\nThe dishes were a culinary journey, perfectly suited to the rainy weather outside. We began with a warm, sweet steamed custard soup that was comforting and delicious. Each subsequent dish was a masterpiece, from the kingfish with nori and Japanese herb to the bluefin tuna belly that melted in my mouth. Personal highlights included the tuna tartar handroll with warm rice and crisp nori, the rich abalone with sweet sauce, and the prawn topped with caviar, which was so good we ordered it again after the main course.\n\nThe attention to detail was impeccable--fresh ginger was constantly replenished to cleanse the palate, and each dish's flavors were thoughtfully balanced without overwhelming the senses. The sake pairing, starting with a light Matsuno Tsukasa Kimoto Junmaishu and progressing to a richer Tsukino Katsura Asahi, was expertly chosen by the waitress and complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nThe dessert course capped the evening beautifully, especially the egg custard flambeed with sugar, reminiscent of a delicate creme brulee. Mochi with a light sweet sauce and chocolate powder was a delightful and light finish.\n\nThis was my first omakase experience, and it couldn't have been better. The seasonal dishes, the flawless service, and the warm ambiance made for an amazing dining experience. I'll definitely be returning and highly recommend Sushi Hanabi to anyone looking for an exceptional meal in Amsterdam!"",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-09-27T18:50:21"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOIrGxfEB9PKUZ7IhikQghd9LmMag4vNwDjfs59=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPgjYdj_yOhwFOCrslyZSF9dYHKWcla5P4aIYUs=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNc7E4p0iMhZAo3yns9J5gXlfJLMDe9LcLLhY1L=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOnqqIBdaSYCgJU_vwvtalBcuqUf2zBH_IscnAm=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNlU7NmWKAA1qAyvSLlFmMCcVd2uT__5H1Lmhg3=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMldaApQxD0GcHbJ5bh0lX63vBZh-nzSQOCCJoi=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipO3Bg9mePZ81A5H8okkLkOE-AdpbaodQ3R9U2Fe=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMdUDq_2AfXcTOLNIGSELXTnljAljlSV5ZeImBQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMeVLIL6DRw-WRYwi9dCfrkGREES4DsdiDgImdL=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOWHk33oD1rim5FXoMQxTv73GzphDSxThAxxVE-=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNBn0Bj42Biev-XbKuPqB7BSO3SL0ls7KlMMQvz=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNAuBIGLdSsfIutha_ckyfRMS-HbzOkjRJ7YmsI=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPC5ki02yE0qWowhfuVWBcpCwEBF6uFPvePCwx6=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOP5hDMab8R6Vua7oY7V7yies5VWmt2bMH99nZE=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPephniMBdbg3TMLGCSO40RXzzRmghX2NBSjTns=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNABn-H0DcMGQF-o9lGVai3_S_wdARmuzJpWDFR=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMmzFzZsvBmQLlDmlAvkpH2V7jUgSnwN9Ch0h5w=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPC-XWvMjfKyfLZAkFcuSwA4z7O141ITPk8pgmf=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2bnVudnVRRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Karolina Lindblad"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114752358256179400508?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""amazing everything. food was amazing, atmosphere was super calm and perfect.

(Main reason for me giving 3/5 for the food)\n\nI informed my friendly waitress about it and she without hesitation offered me a new order. I definitely think I was unlucky with this and I was very satisfied with the concern and attentiveness to my issue from the staff.\n\nWithin 10 mins, I was served a fresh batch of fried chicken and a bowl of rice and it was delicious.\n\nI am sharing my experience not to undermine this restaurant but to show that they took full accountability for the issue and swiftly dealt with it. They even at the end offered me a discount for the inconvenience.\n\nSo in conclusion, I enjoyed my overall experience, just hope that this doesn't happen to any other customers again."",""published_at"":""6 days ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-01-07T13:43:28"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzbUpPcThnRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Daniel Cher"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107700776005685550019?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Went here for dinner, ordered the dolsot bibimbap, japchae and kimchi pancakes, everything was delicious, felt like we were on korea, the place was busy and yet the service was quick and amazing, very nice and friendly staff, great atmosphere, had a great time!!!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-02T14:08:33"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Wow, What a nice feedback!

Our first night in Amsterdam we had reservations for a boat tour with Those Dam Boat Guys (check out my review on Trip Advisor - awesome). I thought I remembered ordering food for the boat, but in actuality it was only snacks and lots of beer. Needless to say, we needed sustenance, so my son and his girlfriend picked out the Boulevard Cafe.\n\nWe ordered a couple of steak and potato meals, a hamburger and the asparagus with salmon special. All of them were great, but could have been better if I had not miss-timed our meal. We had to have them bag everything togo right when they came out of the kitchen.\n\nThe staff was so kind and generous but also flustered by this sudden change.\n\nI hope to try them again sometime under better circumstances.

recently had the pleasure of dining at Sushi Fanatics in Amsterdam, and it exceeded my expectations. The sushi is incredibly fresh with an impressive variety on the menu. I ordered several dishes, including the Otoro Nigiri, Hokkaido Scallop Nigiri, Unagi Nigiri, and Baka Salmon Maki, along with a few others, and every single one was outstanding. The presentation was beautiful, the fish-to-rice ratio was spot-on, and the quality was so high that it felt like enjoying sushi straight from Japan. They also have a great selection of Matcha desserts. We tried the Matcha Chocolate Tart, which was rich and flavorful, with high-quality Matcha sourced from Uji. The cozy atmosphere of the restaurant made the experience even better. Though it's on the smaller side, we sat at the shared table where you remove your shoes.

It doesn't help that the seating downstairs is located right next to door that is constantly opened for take-away service. It also doesn't help that the seating isn't very comfortable or very accessible.\n\nLastly the staff were friendly but seemed quite aloof, and the phone ordering system is in my opinion a bit gimmicky for the money that you pay.\n\nAgain the food was great but I will likely not return due to the sub-par restaurant experience.

It is nothing to be considered gimmicky or whatsoever. It is a way to ensure our guests do not need to wait and order any moment they want. Also given our menu is wide with many different fish names, it helped ensure all orders were captured accurately. We understand in Europe QR code is still a bit new, but we do see them a lot already in London, Germany and quite some other Japanese restaurants in Amsterdam. Our Asian guests loved them because of the freedom to order anytime and the efficiency. We preferred them due to accuracy we are able to prepare your order. Yet for guests who prefer traditional way to order, our staff also helps take manual orders too :)\nWe apologise however our door entrance partition was very recently broken by someone and we are waiting for new one and someone to come in and install. We hope to be able to get it in soon but our order got delayed by the company several times."",""response_from_owner_ago"":""3 weeks ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2024-12-22T10:42:25"",""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOOCNkTph2PZ_8RD264gzSieFyUl9JIqgWADE61=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmMTZhcWdRRRAB"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Kris G"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100095021839773322765?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Matcha was full of lumps, had a giant fish scale in my otoro.

Food was lovely and there were loads of options to choose from which also catered for Gluten Free and Lactose intolerant guests (which our party had two of) Wide variety of hot drinks too, however, they come in a glass which makes it extremely hard to drink from as the drinks are piping hot, so would advise to wait until these have cooled down before even attempting to take a sip.\n\nWe booked a table for 5 people and were put around a table of 4 so it was cramped but the restaurant was small and busy so I believe this was the best option at the time. We were celebrating a friends birthday and they kindly brought out a complimentary Blueberry muffin that kicked off our day well, thank you.\n\n*SEE PICTURES, I got the London Breakfast, toast could've been toasted a little more and wish the sausage was cooked more all round as I didn't eat it like this."",""published_at"":""9 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-03-14T13:55:06"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOR1G2f1stG-cZgCtuHUEXJLvm0igtdlvBoL7j0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNORYFQ-mlWwR5AlysXJ8rKlyVmuAyqqd5YIzcX=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNKITf8OrfovkSPA784Jj32WZe3SH9C0Oyfs2sw=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmaTYtVGFBEAE"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Claire Smith"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114475843255537452771?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""The service is not great here.

Equally impressive was the kelle paca, a traditional Turkish soup that stood out as a delicacy in its own right.\n\nThe bicak arasi pide was an irresistible delight, boasting a crunchy, thin crust that paired wonderfully with its flavorful toppings of parsley and onions.

These heavenly sweets rounded out an already exceptional dining experience.

First of all, the setting is amazing. It's right by the river and surrounded by trees and flowers, so you can watch boats go by and admire the plant life around you while you eat. The patio might be the most beautiful one I've ever had the pleasure of eating at.\n\nSecondly, the food is delicious. I had scrambled eggs and salmon, and my wife had yogurt with granola and a croissant. Everything tasted great.\n\nAnd, finally, the service is fantastic, too.

One of the best aspects of De Ysbreeker is its authentic, local vibe, a refreshing break from the more tourist-heavy spots. Highly recommend for a genuine Amsterdam experience.

Both were so delicious and the quantity of the meals were very generous and well priced. Will definitely be back when we visit next. Thank you for a lovely meal and ending to our holiday."",""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-10-01T18:05:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hey Annie Rothschild, thanks so much for taking the time to share your amazing experience at Black and Blue!

Service was friendly and quick. We took the vegan burger which was really nice. Crunchy and very juicy and tasty. And the presentation was also nice with the pink bread giving it an extra twist. The Burrata cheese salad with couscous was also very fresh and nice. Next to this we had some coffee and tea. Great experience. The Amstelplein area is modern with Blooker being a nice historical gem in the middle. The area is in rapid development with many new restaurants and hotels opening up next to and close to the Amstel river. Definitely worth checking out if you happen to be in the neighborhood.

But after paying for my tea I still need to pay EU2 for hot water refill?!!That's just being cheap. I know EU2 comparing to the 140 menu is insignificant, but it just gave a very weird sensation through out the experience.\nAside from that, food amazing and sophisticated, best omakase I've had in Europe by far.

It wasn't spectacular but it was yummy. Like other reviews, the service was bad. You can sense that some of the service staff don't get along with each other.

The guy dropped some glasses that smashed everywhere and the girl just saw it happen and nobody said a word. It felt like it was a daily occurrence and she is so over it.

Last night, table of 4, we spent 120 euro per person (!). Excluding drinks after dinner. That used to be some 105 per person previous years. Which was high but worth it given the entertainment. We drunk 8 glasses of wine and 2 glasses of beer. Not too crazy for 4 persons, and similar as other years. Actually went back to my bill today and noted as an example 15 euro for the bread. I would think that should all be in the dinner Dauphine. But in any case 15 euro for 4 minuscule pieces of bread with way too little butter (always a struggle to divide over 4 people) starts feeling bad.  You start hitting the \""this is annoying\"" level. Makes me want to say I don't want the bread. Wanted to leave that with you as constructive criticism. I have noted we started going less because of the price, which is considered too high by many of our friends.  Now, you don't seem to suffer yet as the place was packed last night. And it was a good evening , started not so thrilling in the two first sets of music but the last set Rocked!  But as any marketeer will tell you , there is a price point where people turn away. And it'll be hard to come back from that. In my perspective you are slightly above that point.  We'll see how it goes from here , I sure wish you success because I LOVE the concept of the club."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-23T12:14:15"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqbklxZTFnRRAB"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Anna M"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116953372850691947614?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Good location close to Amstel station.

We followed up on dessert twice, after which it still did not arrive so we ended up cancelling it.

The bread you're referring to is actually from a highly respected bakery Just around the corner. A few years ago we did serve bread coming from the bakery next door you mentioned and we didn't get good responses from our guests. Since we serve this bread (for about 3 years now) we had no complaints about this at all. I guess there's no accounting for taste right? By the way, our main focus is lunch, you're right, but our specialties are not the bread dishes you mentioned but actualy homemade Indonesian food. Prepared by our Indonesian family. You should come back and order this! And please if you do, tell us your honest opinion. We could also discuss your opinion about the bread ofcourse, we take every review seriously. We really hope to see you again Markus!"",""response_from_owner_ago"":""7 years ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2017-08-14T11:16:56"",""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBcE4teFJBEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Andre Saraiva"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110057464422839832432?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Vwry cozery cozy and polite.

Unfortunately still frozen inside and warm outside.\nProbably better to go here for lunch/dinner/bar instead of coffee and cake.\n\nNice big terrace with outside seating and sun, staff was very friendly :)"",""published_at"":""2 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2022-09-03T11:25:24"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN3mkrWqkhReoWOo9qD5N7uk9m_QvpLYAEJq7no=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOKjWCcm4AYoug5-fRBwJ4TOAjtFgOfJyj_V6yX=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP4ZSggca7sbUOiH-pdrjOg3LkH5HlW-nN9Ii2C=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYNnRiUU93EAE"",""rating"":4,""name"":""Lois Markesteijn"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115948785357739717538?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Went here with some friends for the jazz night, it was lovely and fun!

aan de Amstel in Amsterdam. It was nothing short of spectacular. I planned the event from California, without ever having seen the venue in person. The Ode aan de Amstel team made the entire experience seamless and extraordinary.\n\nFrom our very first interaction, their professionalism and enthusiasm were evident. They worked closely with me to design the event (including a five-course meal) that was both exquisite and perfectly tailored to our preferences for the event. Their attention to detail was impeccable; every course was a masterpiece, beautifully presented as a fine dining experience.\n\nThe staff went above and beyond to ensure that our special event went off without a hitch. They executed our vision with precision, from the elegant table settings to the personalized touches that made the evening unforgettable. The ambiance was intimate yet sophisticated, making it the perfect backdrop for a memorable celebration with friends and family from around the world.\n\nThe restaurant also did an exceptional job catering to our specific requests, including special dietary needs (where my son and a few guests had food allergies).\n\nIn every way, Ode aan de Amstel exceeded our expectations. If you're looking for a venue that combines exceptional cuisine, attentive service, and a beautiful setting, look no further. I wholeheartedly recommend Ode aan de Amstel for any special event--your celebration will be in the best hands.\n\nThank you to the entire team for making my husband's milestone birthday a truly magical experience.

a 10 mins tram ride away from Amsterdam Central, The restaurant is at a good location with lot of other restaurants around it as well. As we entered the restaurant we really liked the vibes. Songs with cool beats in the background, nice friendly ambiance, perfect for the evenings for sure. In drinks we ordered Mexican beer Dos Equis and Margarita Miss Picantona. From the bites we ordered Jalapeno poppers and Totopos. The bites were really yummy and we enjoyed them with the drinks. We then ordered Tacos (chicken and veg), it was also really nice in taste. For the next round of drinks we ordered Michelada Special (beer + tequila)  and it was really great as well. The staff at the restaurant is very friendly and always happy to help with the menu. Overall a good experience and worth going in the evenings. Good to have reservation as it can get busy.\n\nPS: Although, must add that we found the place a relatively pricey as compared to other restaurants.

Before our food arrived, one staff member stood right behind my chair with his hand on it, listening in on our private conversation, which was incredibly intrusive. To make matters worse, while we were eating, I was bizarrely told to switch to another seat for no apparent reason, further disrupting the experience.\n\nWhen it came to the food, the ribs were overly sweet and sickly, and the salad looked nothing like the menu photos. While it did fill me up for the evening, the quality left much to be desired.\n\nThe final interaction was the most off-putting. When the bill arrived, the older waiter made a point of highlighting the tip section and seemed displeased when I chose not to add one. He sulked, walked away without thanking us, and didn't even say goodbye.\n\nThis restaurant has potential with its fair pricing and ambiance, but the staff's attitude and the food quality need serious improvement to make it a place worth recommending."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-19T15:32:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NWR2SHN3RRAB"",""rating"":2,""name"":""Abu Isaac"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115443352950219315272?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Food was lovely.

Our server showed my wife how to cut the fish off the bone which came off smoothly and she had a beautiful fillet.\nIberico - the four pieces were succulent (tasty and juicy), and just the right texture of firm inside and browned outside. The zucchini had a delicious sauce.\nPoussin - the meat was juicy and tender, with a fresh poultry (compared to the near tasteless of processed chicken) taste that was accented with the herbs. Served with drawn butter for a rich, smooth finish.\nFries - golden, crisp and crunchy outside, tender inside.\nGoat cheesecake - I was thinking a goat cheese would have too strong a taste for a dessert, and this was amazing. The cheese, fruit, and gingerbread crust were in perfect balance. Just enough cheese to have a creamy, sweet taste. Fresh berries. Crumbly and warm crust.\n\nThe wine was a glass of Domaine Robert Sirugue (usually by the bottle, our server was willing to sell a glass) - which the server described as \""a big hug.\"" The wine and his description was perfect.

There were long gaps in service from when we arrived to receiving the menus to receiving our food and no explanation as to why, until we asked.

I have been looking for a restaurant that combined artisan cocktails, creative and tasteful dishes and fine-dining experience in a laid-back way. This is definitely @larette_amsterdam  I have fallen for each piece I have eaten here; starting with the fantastic sourdough bread, then the harmoniously crafted entries and the incredible short rib along with the leek and aubergine that could compete with the main. Let's say AMEN for the man behind the bar who has created and prepared amazing set of cocktails. I am really amazed by the drinks menu, especially because the cocktails section is incredibly wide, from most-loved traditionals to signature house blends. It captures your heart the minute you see the location, just by a canal and sitting by the window, you can't help but feel romantic. The interior is gorgeously decorated and branded with great attention to details but it is so subtle that it doesn't bother you, instead it is artistic. The food is also influenced by this artistic spririt. From the tableware to cutlery, from drinks to food garnishing, everything is on point. The service is incredible, handsome people attending to your dining experience with great care, what more can I ask for?

The food was excellent, I had the vegan steak, which I could tell wasn't real meat but still great. The jue was fantastic with the brown bread. I would recommend those who can't eat meat.\n\n2. The customer service was fantastic, catered to or needs, and they were very polite and friendly.\n\n3. Toilets are very important and I was very impressed by how clean and tidy they were. Not to mention, the cubicles smelt great (lol).\n\n4. For the price, the food quality, service, and overall outing were well worth it.\n\nI would highly recommend this place as it really deserves the 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nTaste:  \nValue for Money:  \nAtmosphere:  \nCustomer Service:  \nMenu:  \nLocation:  \nParking: \nWould I recommend: \n\nThanks."",""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-02-21T16:07:53"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNfG0iwkN2r0tHeoCUZs8hocHUWdYgmxVhm8nqo=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNEmgDFNKW8sIv1hPbNh7YUNyzqIYcUk2Zc0Uvq=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNk15rpYS7ZSqleP8vImMnUgYCJl8tjyzKyreXw=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPEPQqh4OCjYUQWrQ3dOyw7FOEFCOEp1s89uCD0=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPtS-PN619aAT14t-2o4-OA_n_5CcMbeePSjXo5=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOnLiy4d0blFLyo9LbLlp-s62ahy150fZGrcGJ5=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOfGbl--fJet9_A8woV14spqsG2i0Q0Nx1THokI=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMHHUFrNAndEdPQhxHmJx3OB0Lm1cluF7HzLBSx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPfoesOUny5gxCPiTTVJsB5fbEHnjb1rKTug6L4=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMF_4NHzS6ZSGQdx8I19yPBrtNs4cZv-0DYEp_m=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4bmZxYUdnEAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Out and About Amsterdam"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101864906857906047145?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""A culinary gem in Amsterdam Oost that draws inspiration from the vibrant food scene of New York City \n\nQuality, tastiness and elegance are the basis of Larette's food.

It's definitely worth a visit. Service was good.\nWhen you enter Central Station from the main entrance, you just walk to the right and see the stairs going up. You need to walk straight to go to the restaurant."",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-23T08:53:34"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNz18tyNGbkA-ead2aXLNkWyO1r7NzhFYhi1XcT=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMMRgUU42EdYR83q0ITD_rzfO2epH2IddLIFDGN=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNBjtwbECC9Rp-MLWJTyNZJOCVfjLCwWVPvZCgX=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN19slYLAka6DvLjf0VIvGkG0bUxPW6M32x2vZW=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuanZiNlZBEAE"",""rating"":3,""name"":""Tadd Wun"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107789587504301573325?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Great ambience n nostalgia but food was below average.

At first glance the design of old space is beautiful, but then you meet a waiter, who gives you sort of annoying look and then ignores you, so you just pass by and search for a table by yourself. We took a table near the bar and were surprised to see beautiful big parrot. That pure animal just an alive decoration here. She is not allowed to move from her stick. When she tried to walk out from her small place, waiter wrapped her in a towel, put back on stick and then start to spray with a water on parrot from all sides, like a punishment. The bird was screaming deafeningly. I really think it's not a best place for animal.\nAbout the food, we took a beef broth, which was tasty but looked very poor - only liquid and few mushrooms. We also took couple of beers and a snack plate for 21 euro and it was really bad looking, with rough crushed sausage, cheapest cheese and overfried snacks. Wasted money, time and last impression."",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-08-08T21:36:53"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPWXwun-TwnFRg_OnCB2H1waeyPdAMrfORBIVc=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3dUt5bDR3RRAB"",""rating"":3,""name"":""Martin McBride"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108870175842514871252?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Surprisingly hard to find being in the main railway station but once found it's busy, bustling, and a bit of a bust.\n\nService was very quick and the dishes all pre-prepared - mediocre at best, especially considering the price.

We asked for water while deciding on our drinks, but it didn't arrive until we asked again. Our Prosecco and water were finally brought out together, but the Prosecco was just below room temperature. We requested ice for our ice bucket, which was promptly provided.\n\nOur starter, a prawn salad priced at EU15.50, was disappointingly small and tasted ok. However, the main course was visually appealing, with four prawns and a generous amount of tasty sauce. The staff appeared to be doing their best but clearly lacked proper training from the management. The ambiance was delightful, maintaining a beautiful, timeless charm.\n\nIn summary, while the restaurant has potential with its beautiful setting and some tasty dishes, the service and value for money need significant improvement."",""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-20T18:33:25"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNaG4ouHDGRxDQXpfmpEPmJm7yUPnC_CgyPZvNx=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMe__LL9PjwQDyT5DAiQYySLdOMaqg26hIpN0CN=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNrkUXhWWp26LYoqkcXqnOehsMgIOU8tKpE1drL=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkOFBldGF3EAE"",""rating"":3,""name"":""Renee Williams-Genas"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100612460261754164828?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Food is somewhat abysmal, as well as the service but the room itself and the atmosphere is stunning.

Disappointing at best. I genuinely don't understand how it gets such a high review.\n\nFirstly it took 1,5 hrs to get our food once ordered. The bread we were served was hard and dried out.\nSince it was taking so long, we asked for a salad and they said 'yes of course', but we were served a plate of vegetable antipasti instead.\nWhen we asked for some vinegar for our bread, we were unpleasantly surprised when we were given chili oil instead.\nAfter about an hour of waiting, we asked them where our food was and the waitress said they were waiting to serve our pasta until we were done the \""salad\"" even though there had been nothing but a small piece of arugula left on the plate for the last 20 min.\nWhile we continued to wait, the inside was noisy and hard to have a conversation. Every few minutes the background music was interrupted by ads for Albert Heijn (at the price of the food they can't just pay for Spotify premium?...)\nOnce we got the food, it came out all at different times, with one of our guests getting his food 15 minutes later than everyone else.\nPlus, EU25 for pasta that takes 1,5hrs is extortionate. Ultimately, maybe it would have tasted better if we didn't wait so long, but in the end it tasted rather unremarkable. On the upside, the wine was pretty decent, but we needed it.

I dived into the Alba and Foer Restaurant collab in Amsterdam, where chefs Steven Broere and George Kataras took us on a culinary joyride. Each course was like a little masterpiece--super unique, gorgeously presented, and absolutely delicious.\n\nWe kicked off with an onion broth mixed with angelica oil and black currant, light yet aromatic, teasing my taste buds for what was to come. Next, the potato bread topped with turbot roe and bronze fennel? Game changer! One bite, and I was hooked--the perfect blend of richness and texture.\n\nThe charred veggies with celeriac and horseradish had this smoky, spicy kick that was just awesome. And then, BBQ mackerel with plums and chorizo oil? Talk about bold flavors! The balance of smoky fish, sweet plum, and a hint of heat made it unforgettable.\n\nBut the surprises didn't stop there--the salsify with coffee kombucha and hazelnut brought a cool earthy twist, and the chicken paired with hen of the woods mushrooms and blackberry tasted like a cozy forest picnic in autumn.\n\nThen came the grand finale: a blood orange and Sichuan pepper donut that was as playful as it was refreshing. Sweet, spicy, and just the right amount of zing--a perfect end to this flavor-packed journey. And don't even get me started on the wine pairings--they weren't just good, they were spot-on with each dish, enhancing every flavor without stealing the spotlight.\n\nHighly recommend this for anyone looking for a memorable, inventive dining experience in Amsterdam!"",""published_at"":""2 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-01T08:14:37"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":0,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOd035HH7CK95Xg0qphzZR_DsSIUaP5lWtq8E2Q=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOHa4DXc9t0UV2ORir9e7lwzUi-xla6pBkgH4wC=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN-z-DIb6J32Mm-MLutQib0gxGNHHfnmlKzy2T_=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOZOc3neIyaA4nsLE9gdJyeHgkZMCx6AbE2dEPJ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOUYDDkfSpRzjxYD5Deo8G1RafFY8vGvo_P3h1Y=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPbJYNY01GOqCsU2AmoTGpBdqt2diGlkZV1VGhn=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipM22EaHZc6cOhdfrfihwVJJKjBRMDl1z5eZ28tH=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPPukvdavWT48wpiPA6W0PP_ew-sy6Bf7zKLdAQ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipP-twJknZdRD0OlqAP1v4SdtZuGKK6uG-72QxUu=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNImatR9o9PZIu3vFmNc7pmiBggRnbvxbsN_gQB=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPoHjDeajgtJcsknD0vP2kcDoii8IxwDbaSlWaN=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMwfWdT6_9T6B6qgVGFcyiWiOI_lh_8bIHg5C_S=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNYGGFyZWg8BfVINLgGhfsC9raCKTjJ9xwBAQHJ=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPorfSX544bGkYqcOg2t2CIp_27JS2lmC4Fp6M5=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPsvCdXQIMZJy9_qF_0lk5_7PLve5Xx9GMe6GT2=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipN82TtVTFUtURe_vNNbiM70KjLYGnj4LYacVsAD=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNV7b3reQx1CIEknk5ZQsml6axOv73NA_48hIXB=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOsjbXynWEI1m0fNZ04wBkeXh67xwyMhgKqXZ7u=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipNXs77stKki7HMKzPpug99km_8KHTeKQZRdq5SW=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMdThuQ1dREAE"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Cameron Watson"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110724602513690588831?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""Some of the best food I've ever had in Amsterdam, and amazing value considering the number of dishes you can have as part of the set menu!\nCreative, beautiful, delicious and served by friendly and knowledgeable waiters and chefs.\nThe wines were perfectly paired and the home made kombucha cocktails were the best I've ever had.\nCan't recommend enough, particularly for vegetarian fine dining."",""published_at"":""6 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-07-01T10:24:47"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""review_likes_count"":1,""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":null,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":null,""is_local_guide"":false,""review_translated_text"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""review_photos"":[""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPvAZrRw13SjobEMrQHDl9ocwdoRGVwwmpPFZ3I=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPkE_sWnw1ZiO6GsUCMxe5Yne3QIPeu8qP3xafj=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipODHoJfrtUZBzILW8DGYi9HNM4HShGJ1ZBqxjn3=s1024"",""https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPKs5FnA6pu94rQgqdtx5X4BGAYhLGGgeIOI7gM=s1024""]},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYMmRPdW5nRRAB"",""rating"":5,""name"":""Florencia Eli"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110017391534770133869?hl=en-GB"",""review_text"":""We had a delicious experience at Foer.

Our guests are the current Dappermarket visitors, young starters and tourists who dare to step off the beaten track. There is more to Amsterdam than the Leidseplein and Dam square.

a try. The dish we ordered came out just OK so we asked additional chilies and fish sauce to spice it up and then the history starts! The chef (Mr.Kay/Candy) came out to served us so we had a bit of conversations. He mentioned that he will cook it again as the authentic taste but we refused and wanted to try next time. Later he served us another dish as a compliment and it tastes like home. We really appreciate his kindness. So, we would like to give it a try again.\n\nAfter a few weeks, my friends and I revisited the restaurant again and we ordered the food a week in advance! Some of them are not even in the menu but they were very kind to prepare them all  for us. The food was so so good, very spicy and tasteful. All my Thai friends and I feel like we are having Isan food in Thailand. The staffs welcomed us very warmly. The dessert is so good especially the mochi ice cream!\n\nThe chef let us try his Sa-to which is a rice wine that popular in Laos and NE region of Thailand. Oh also, the rice whiskey with some herbs. Even serve us the tea from Laos before we leave. Their services is beyond our expectations. We are really happy and enjoy our time there.\n\nWe will definitely visit here again and try more dish. If you really want the authentic taste, just mention it when you order but make sure you can handle the Asian spice level."",""published_at"":""9 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-04-02T13:05:24"",""response_from_owner_text"":""thank you so much, also on behalf of Kay.

We always like to start off with a cold brewski and off course they had 2 cold Singha's for us. Make reservations now! We started with some fresh Thai spring rolls and they were truly fresh, handmade and delicious. Must try! Then my wife had the Pad Krapao and she ate everything, and I had the Chicken Paneng Curry. I am always afraid that they don't make it spicy enough, but the level of spiciness was just right for me. The chef is from Laos and everything is freshly made. Go there! We didn't have any dessert, we'll do that next time we visit. The neighborhood is fun and the ambiance of Boi Boi is relaxed and fun. Bring a friend!

It felt like eating a 7 course tasting menu but having missed half the courses. Even the cheese board had a laughable dot of chutney. We tried to order bread on the and even that was small. Taste wise, food was fine but also didn't blow me away, lots of soft flavours and lack of anything exciting. In terms of atmosphere it feels very stiff, no music and the interior decor is lacking character. One plus is that they have a nice wine list.\n\nI will not be back and wouldn't recommend this place."",""published_at"":""a month ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-11-17T08:27:00"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for sharing your thoughts Theo, and we're truly sorry to hear about your disappointing experience.

I visited was in a slight panic trying to find takeaway places to order a quick late night meal that catered for my allergens.  By that point, I'd walked around for about 30 minutes trying to find a place with no luck, until I came to Hearth on 11 Oct 2024.  They'd sadly JUST stopped food service when I arrived, but the lovely owner, Marcus, took pity on my plight and offered some excellent gluten free and vegan quinoa sushi with dressing for free.  I was amazed by his wonderful generosity that I made a point to come and visit to try the menu out properly when my friend from London arrived.\n\nAnd that we did.  We visited on Sunday 13 October as walk-ins and everything from the food (presentation and flavour) the non-alcoholic cocktails, the ambience, and the service was nothing short of amazing.  Unfortunately Marcus wasn't there the night I visited as a sit-down guest, but I did offer him one promise...this review, so I send my heartfelt gratitude for his kindness and generosity.  He has a wonderful business.  The food was amazing...I couldn't fault the flavours and textures.  Please do yourself a favour and go - you will not be disappointed by the inventiveness of the dishes and drinks at this place.\n\nThank you again!

An open kitchen with very friendly kitchen staff and overall the people taking care of us were lovely and very attentive.
